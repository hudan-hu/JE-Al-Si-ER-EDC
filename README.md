## Al-Si Alloy ER Extraction Dataset
Al-Si alloy entityâ€“relation extraction dataset, the dataset are randomly divided into a training set (train.txt) and a test set (test.txt) in a ratio of 8:1, 
and one-eighth of the sentences in the training set are randomly selected as the validation set (dev.txt).

## Code
### ELMo training
The file run.txt contains the training launcher, test launcher, weights file storage launcher, which can be started by copying it to the run.sh file.
### Joint extraction model
Run the program: run.sh

Configuration file: bio_config.txt

Functionally graded coatings are coating systems used to increase performances of high temperature components in diesel engines . 
These coatings consist of a transition from the metallic bond layer to cermet and from cermet to the ceramic layer . 
In this study , thermal behavior of functional graded coatings on AlSi and steel piston materials was investigated by means of using a commercial code , namely ANSYS . 
Thermal analyses were employed to deposit metallic , cermet and ceramic powders such as NiCrAl , NiCrAl + MgZrO 3 and MgZrO 3 on the substrate . 
The numerical results of AlSi and steel pistons are compared with each other . 
It was shown that the maximum surface temperature of the functional graded coating AlSi alloy and steel pistons was increased by 28 % and 17 % , respectively.Eutectic Al-Si alloys are typically used for the production of internal combustion engine pistons . 
A high-cycle , high-temperature fatigue characterization of AlSi12 alloy performed using specimens extracted from actual pistons is presented and discussed . 
Fatigue strength at 107 cycles were obtained at test temperatures of 250 °C , 300 °C and 350 °C . 
Effect laws of different rolling deformation on the microstructure and mechanical properties of alloy plate Mg-12Li-3AlSi alloy were researched . 
The results show that with the increase of rolling deformation , tensile strength of the alloy increases significantly , and elongation increases first then decreases . 
The total rolling deformation is controlled between 85 % and 90 % , then Mg-12Li-3AlSi has excellent comprehensive mechanical properties.Hypereutectic and eutectic AlSi-base alloys find frequent application in casting automotive components . 
The properties of this type of alloy depend significantly on their solidification microstructure , especially the size , shape , and distribution of primary and eutectic silicon . 
The serial sectioning technique was applied for determining the three-dimensional ( 3D ) microstructure of an Al-18wt. % Si alloy . 
For clear identification of both the larger primary Si particles grown in the melt and the fine lamellar eutectic Si , a series of two-dimensional equidistant cross sections were metallographically prepared . 
The microstructure in these cross sections was detected and observed at high resolution using a light microscope . 
The images were stored in a digital library . 
The 3D reconstruction of primary Si particles and AlSi eutectic was achieved through the application of various software tools . 
This provided data about the faceted growth behavior of octahedral Si particles and feathery eutectic Si . 
The image stack was also imported to hierarchical data format ( version 5 ) ( HDF5 ) open source format , thus , enabling availability of the 3D image data to the wider community . 
In this way , 3D reconstructions of this kind can contribute to a greater understanding of processing/microstructure property relationships in hypereutectic AlSi alloys.The present work is to develop a wear resistant coating on the surface of hypereutectic AlâSi alloy . 
By using our newly developed sol enhanced electroplating method , NiâTiO2 composite coating has been deposited on AlâSi alloy samples . 
The microstructure and property of the surface coating were analysed . 
The results show that , compared with the traditional Ni coating , the microhardness of the sol enhanced NiâTiO2 coating was significantly increased by â¼30 % . 
Meanwhile , the corrosion property was also improved . 
The result indicates that this newly developed NiâTiO2 coating can provide surface protection and broaden the applications of hypereutectic AlâSi alloy.react-text : 161 Corrosion resistance of CrN PVD coatings were evaluated with polarization tests in NaCl and HCl environment . 
The effect of the deposition technique and the related defects morphology were studied and corrosion mechanisms were evaluated on the basis of the detected defects type . 
It was found that the presence of two layers in coating architecture delays corrosion ; The study presents the electroless N-P-C < sub > g < /sub > -SiC composite coating on cast AlSi ( ADC12 ) alloy where the bath temperature is maintained at 90°C , pH level is controlled between 4.5 to 5.0 and stirred at 450 rpm with mechanical stirrer to avoid particles sedimentation . 
The increase of the coating film thickness is very insignificant after one hour of coating duration . 
This outcome is supposed to be due to inconsistent chemical concentration in the plating bath after this period . 
The nominal coating thickness of 39 μm is achieved after the substrate is immersed for 1 hour in four consecutive plating baths , respectively . 
The coating film is also successfully adhered to the substrate surface with the SiC and C < sub > g < /sub > particles are homogenously distributed.The design of materials through the selection of the chemical composition , thermodynamic modelling , melt treatment , correctly developed casting technology followed by adequate heat treatment could improve casting properties . 
A wide range of complex reactions and intermetallic phases occurs due to numerous alloying ( Si , Mg , Cu ) and trace elements ( Fe , Mn ) interaction . 
Determination of solidification sequence was performed by modeling of equilibrium phase diagram , simultaneous thermal analysis and metallographic investigations . 
Microstructure revealed needle-like Al5SiFe and Chinese script phase Al15 ( Fe , Mn , Cu ) 3Si2 enriched in copper . 
Copper addition resulted in formation of compact complex intermetallic phases Al5Cu2Mg8Si6 and Al8FeMg3Si6 . 
Solidification ended with secondary eutectic phases Mg2Si and Al2Cu . 
Wide spectra of favourable intermetallic phases comprehend to the tensile mechanical properties development already in as-cast state . 
Comparison of yield and tensile strength with commonly used AlSi7Mg alloy indicates significant increase of investigated properties for innovative chemistry of AlSi7Mg ( Cu ) alloy in as-cast state.Gas porosity is one of the most common defects in aluminum alloy parts manufactured by solidification processing , and can have a strong influence on fatigue properties . 
This study shows that gas pores with a fraction of 0.2–1.6 % and an average size of 20–55μm are present in the Al-Si alloy parts manufactured by Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) . 
Failure after fatigue testing was found to initiate from surface or subsurface gas pores and fatigue life prediction equations were developed considering the influence of pores . 
The building direction did not have a statistically verifiable effect on the average gas porosity fraction , size and distribution , although the scatter in porosity fraction was greater in the vertically built specimens . 
At the same applied stress , the fatigue life of SLM manufactured specimens decreased with an increase in pore size , and specimens built horizontally exhibited a greater fatigue life than those built vertically . 
The cause is attributed to greater propensity of cracks to propagate along lower strength melt pool boundary layers in vertically built specimens.Morphologies of tensile fracture surface of heat-treated alloys with different ( La+Yb ) contents ( a ) 0 ; ( b ) 0.3 wt. % ; ( c ) 0.6 wt. % ; ( d ) 0.9 wt. % The article examines the impact of changes in homogenization temperature in the hardening process on the microstructure of aluminum alloys . 
The research samples were cast from AlSi10CuNiMn alloy produced by gravity casting technology in metal mold . 
Subsequently , the castings were subjected to a heat treatment . 
In an experiment with changing temperature and staying time in the process of homogenization . 
The microstructure of the alloy was investigated by methods of light and electron microscopy . 
Examination of the microstructure has focused on changing the morphology of separated particles of eutectic silicon and intermetallic phases . 
The analysis of intermetallic phases was supplemented by an analysis of the chemical composition – EDS analysis . 
Effect of heat treatment on the properties investigated alloy was further complemented by Vickers microhardness . 
Investigated alloy is the result of longtime research conducted at the Faculty of Production Technology and Management.This paper presents mathematical models derived from the study of the chemical composition and mechanical properties of aluminum alloy type 6082 AlSi < sub > 1 < /sub > MgMn . 
They were determined based on the study of the chemical composition of 30 batches of alloy 6082 and their mechanical properties . 
Mathematical models obtained were checked by Fisher test , and the two of them had the optimal coefficient of determination . 
Aluminum alloy was hot rolled and hardened through heat treatments.The microstructure and heterogeneous nucleation phenomena in cast SiC p -reinforced hypereutectic AlâSi/alloy composites have been studied . 
Composite specimens were prepared using the compocasting technique and followed by remelting at 1023 K. The microstructure evolution of the composite has been investigated by water quenching the composite specimens at different stages of solidification . 
It has been observed that SiC particles can serve as substrate for the primary Si particles but not for Î±-Al dendrites . 
Instead primary Î±-Al dendrites push SiC particles into the last solidified liquid . 
In the presence of SiC particles , the eutectic silicon morphology changes from plate and needle shape of the unreinforced alloy to just plate shape . 
Globularisation of primary Î±-Al dendrites occurs at the eutectic temperature while primary Si crystals tend to agglomerate as solidification proceeds . 
As a result both the average size and the average volume fraction of the primary Si crystals increases . 
A significant refinement in the size of eutectic silicon can also be observed but only in the regions where SiC particles are present.abstract This paper presents a physical model characterizing the geometry of gas-assisted laser cutting of the AlSi-alloy/SiCp composite . 
In the model , a lot of relevant parameters that describe the inhomogeneous optical and thermophysical properties of AlSi-alloy/SiC p have been used . 
Numerical evaluations of this model give some explanations of `` double slope '' formation mechanism during laser cutting of the AlSi-alloy/SiC p . 
The theoretical results are compared with experimental data . 
It is found that increasing laser beam scanning speed increases the slope of cutting front .

The comprehensive properties of a feedstock have a critical influence on the powder injection molding process . 
Proper feedstock with homogeneous structure , favorable flow characteristic , and moldability is the prerequisite for obtaining a final part with excellent comprehensive properties . 
The objective of the present work was to develop an optimal feedstock for fabrication of hypereutectic AlSi ( 20 wt. % ) alloy parts by the powder injection molding technique . 
For this purpose , micron-sized hypereutectic AlSi ( 20 wt. % ) alloy powder was mixed with different amounts of a binder which consisted of 35 wt. % high-density polyethylene , 62 wt. % carnauba wax , and 3 wt. % stearic acid . 
The binder contents of the feedstocks were in the range from 13 wt. % to 21 wt. % . 
The influences of binder content , shear rate , and temperature on the rheological behaviors of feedstocks have been investigated via a capillary rheometer . 
The feedstock with 21 wt. % binder exhibited a variable flow behavior and was culled . 
The rest of the feedstocks showed a pseudoplastic behavior . 
Comprehensive analysis of rheological parameters such as the flow behavior index , yield stress , flow activation energy , and the general moldability index , the feedstock with 17 wt. % binder exhibited the best rheological performance and favorable moldability . 
The molded part with 17 wt. % binder had constant density , good shape retention , and stiffness as well as homogeneous distribution of the powder and binder . 
After solvent debinding , the debound item showed a homogeneous porous structure which is suitable for the subsequent thermal debinding and sintering processes . 
A composite AlSi alloy substrate was fabricated to eliminate thermal expansion coefficient mismatch in high-power vertical light-emitting diodes ( VLEDs ) . 
At 2000-mA injection current , the light output power performance of LED/sapphire , VLED/Si , and VLED/AlSi are 1458 , 2465 , and 2499 mW and the wall-plug efficiencies are 13.66 % , 26.39 % , and 28.02 % , respectively . 
The enhanced performance is attributable to the lower tensile stress and series resistance in VLED/AlSi than in LED/sapphire . 
The surface temperature of LED/AlSi is almost identical to and lower than that of LED/Si and LED/sapphire , respectively . 
Raman spectroscopy confirms that the residual strain in GaN film bonding on the composite AlSi is lower than that on bulk sapphire.Semi-solid ingots of an AlSi7Mg alloy were obtained using the method of near liquidus casting . 
Their micro- structures exhibit the characteristics of fine , equiaxed , and non-dendrite , which are required for semi-solid forming . 
The in- fluences of casting temperature , heat preservation time , and cooling rate on the microstructure were also investigated . 
The results show that in the temperature region near liquidus the grain size becomes small with a decrease in casting temperature . 
Prolonging the heat preservation time makes grain crassitude at the same temperature . 
And increasing the cooling rate makes grain fine . 
The microstructure of the alloy cast with iron mould is finer than that with graphite mould.The optical microscopy , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and energy-dispersive spectrometry ( EDS ) were used to as-sess the influence of micro-addition of ( La+Yb ) on the microstructure and mechanical performance of the AlSi10Cu3 alloy in heat treatment conditions . 
It was shown that the appropriate ( La+Yb ) addition ( 0.3 wt. % or 0.6 wt. % ) transformed the needle-likeβ-Al5FeSi phase into Chinese script or sphericalα-Al8Fe2Si phase . 
Eutectic silicon refined the long needle-like particles into granular or round particles at 0.6 wt. % ( La+Yb ) content . 
Moreover , the La3Al11 and YbAl3 phases acted as strengthening phases during the heat treatment processing in the alloy with the addition of ( La+Yb ) . 
Consequently , the alloy with 0.6 wt. % ( La+Yb ) exhibited an en-hanced mechanical properties response with ultimate tensile strength , elongation , and hardness at 69.35 % , 113.26 % and 23.61 % higher than those of the unmodified alloy , respectively . 
Further addition ( 0.9 wt. % ) of ( La+Yb ) resulted in the increasing of the black acicular RE-rich intermetallics during heat treatment , which could aggravate the situation of stress concentration leading to deteriora-tion of the mechanical properties of alloy.The microstructural evolution during solution treatment at 500 °C of a cast AlSi12Cu4Ni2 piston alloy is evaluated by two dimensional and three dimensional imaging methods aiming at identifying the microstructural features affecting the processes of damage formation and accumulation under tensile deformation . 
Highly interconnected networks of aluminides and Si undergo a local loss of connecting branches within these networks owing to the partial dissolution of Cu-rich aluminides and a slight Si spheroidisation . 
The damage by tensile deformation is studied using synchrotron tomography during in situ tensile tests . 
In both studied heat treatment conditions ( 0 h and 4 h solution treated ) damage initiates in the form of micro-cracks in clusters of primary Si particles and debonding at the interface between Si and the matrix . 
These micro-cracks grow through intermetallic phases in the last stages of deformation . 
Final failure occurs by coalescence of these cracks mainly through the rigid phases . 
The loss of connectedness of the Si-intermetallics network during solution treatment allows the alloy to accommodate more damage and plastic strain resulting in an increase of ductility with respect to the as cast condition.Bugelnig , Katrin ; Sket , Federico ; Germann , Holger ; Steffens , Thomas ; Koos , Robert ; Wilde , Fabian ; Boller , Elodie ; Requena , GuillermoTreatment of metal alloys is one of the ways to affect the quality and properties of the material at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering of the Jan Evangelista Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem , ... Abstract The paper presents the influence of modification with phosphorus ( CuP10 ) on the tribological properties of the alloy AlSi17Cu5Mg coupled abrasively with cast-iron EN GJL-350 . 
Tests of coefficient of friction and wear of mass were conducted on tribological tester T-01 . 
An important aspect in the assessment of the tribological properties is the analysis of initial material microstructure in reference to silumin which underwent modification with phosphorus . 
It was found that the difference in structure of tested materials , mainly sizes of primary silicon crystals significantly influences the tribological properties whereas the speed change of the friction knot does not have such big influence.Aluminum alloys have been widely studied due to their good mechanical properties and recyclability during the last decade . 
In relation to ternary Al-XMg-YZr alloys , where X and Y are amounts in weight , with values for Y above the solid solubility as in liquid , it is verified that their physical-chemistries characteristics . 
In the dissertation the influence of overheating of around 250 < sup > o < /sup > C above T < sub > liq < /sub > on the material reliability of AlSi17Cu5 cast alloy has been shown . 
On the basis of static tensile test , the following had been determined : HB hardness , tensile strength and yield strength for four , chosen technological variants . 
The results were the base to verify the thesis of compliance between tested feature arrangement and normal arrangement , and on this ground also material reliability determined with Weibull ’ s statistic arrangement had been defined . 
This parameter grasp the interdependence between lasting probability and chosen material property of the alloy.Objective : To explore the effect of pulmonary segment lavage under bronchoscope in the treatment of pneumoconiosis.Methods:100 patients with pneumoconiosis were selected , they were treated with pulmonary segment lavage under bronchoscope.Results : The clinical symptoms , FVC and partial pressure of oxygen were improved obviously after treatment.Conclusion : The effect of pulmonary segment lavage under bronchoscope in the treatment of pneumoconiosis was significant.In the present study , a rotating cylinder viscometer ( RCV ) was adopted to measure the viscosity of AlSi10MnMg aluminum alloy . 
The results show that the measured viscosity is much higher than previously reported viscosity of aluminum alloys measured by oscillation vessel viscometer . 
The viscosity measured by RCV was introduced into the simulation of the filling progress of high pressure die casting ( HPDC ) for thin-walled castings of aluminum alloy ( TWCA ) . 
The simulated results match well with the experimental results indicating that the RCV is the most appropriate to use for simulations of HPDC for TWCA.Presented work discusses research results concerning the effect of the T6 heat treatment process , including soaking of the alloy near the solidus temperature , holding in this temperature and next cooling in cold water ( 20 oC ) , as well as exposing to the artificial ageing to check the change in HB hardness and microstructure of the EN AC-AlSi12Cu-NiMg ( EN AC-48000 ) alloy modified with strontium and cast into metal moulds . 
The temperature range of solutioning and ageing treatments was selected on the basis of crystallization curves recorded with the use of thermal-derivative method . 
Performed investigations enabled to determine the optimal parameters ( temperature and time ) of solutioning and ageing heat treatments and their effect on the change in alloy ’ s hardness.WT10.BZ ] Laser surface melting ( LSM ) modified layers on cast AlSi alloy were obtained using a CO_2 continuous transverse flow laser beam with maximum power of 10kW The microstructure of LSM modified layers were studied by using optical microscope , scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) and energy dispersive spectroscope ( EDS ) , transmission electron microscope ( TEM ) and Xray diffraction ( XRD ) It is shown that LSM modified layer could be divided in cellular , dendritic and mixed crystal zones The grain size of LSM modified layers became much finer than that of substrate material The results of Xray diffraction ( XRD ) and selected area diffraction ( SAD ) analysis indicated that much more silicon atoms were saturated in crystalline cells of αAl phase through LSM processing Microhardness distribution from surface to substrate on cross section plane was also tested The average microhardness of LSM modified layers were in the range from 116 to 203HV , and wear resistance was enhanced greatly Generally , improvement of mechanical property was due to the effects of finegrained microstructure and oversaturated αAl crystalline in LSM modified layersIn situ surface composites of hypereutectic AlSi alloy , which possess the microstructures of accumulated primary silicon in outer layer or accumulated primary silicon in outer and inner layers and no primary silicon in the rest layer , have been achieved using preheated metal mould centrifugal casting . 
The formation process of the composites has been analyzed , and the structure , hardness and wear ability of the composites have been also investigated.In the present study , the effect of primary processing route on the dissolution and precipitation reactions in a commercial Al−Si alloy ( designated as A390 ) is investigated using differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) . 
The Al−Si alloy selected for the present investigation was processed using conventional casting and spray atomization and deposition routes . 
The results of differential scanning calorimetry conducted on the as-processed samples indicated no significant dissolution reaction for the as-cast A390 alloy when compared to the similar results obtained for as-spray atomized and deposited samples . 
However , the thermal analysis conducted on the solutionized cast and spray deposited samples exhibited no significant difference in the kinetics of precipitation reactions . 
The results of the differential thermal analyses were finally rationalized in terms of observed microstructural features.Microstructure improvements of a nickel electrodeposited Al−Si alloy were studied after high-power laser melting treatment through a single pass or partially overlapping successive adjacent passes . 
In some cases , laser melting treatment was preceded by a 5-hour heating of the specimens at 500°C in argon atmosphere furnace . 
Microstructure observations and microhardness measurements were carried out on the specimens before and after laser melting treatment with and without preheating . 
Best results concerning microhardness , microstructural homogeneity , and porosity elimination , as well as adhesion of the nickel coating on the Al−Si alloy , were achieved when the specimens were first subjected to heating at 500°C in an argon atmosphere furnace for 5 hours and then submitted to a laser melting treatment through successive adjacent laser passes with an overlapping rate of 70 pct . 
Microstructure studies were carried out employing X-ray diffraction analysis ( XRD ) and energy-dispersive spectrometry ( EDS ) . 
AlNi and Al 3 Ni phases were detected in the diffusion area which resulted from the 5-hour heating . 
AlNi , Al 3 Ni , and Al 3 Ni 2 phases were identified in the laser melted zones ( LMZs ) . 
Each one of the above phase was found to be the main phase under different conditions.AlSi ( LM6 ) alloy and 3 wt. % graphite particle composites were synthesised using a solidification processing technique . 
The morphology of silicon was altered by sodium modification and heat treatment . 
Wear tests were conducted under dry and partially liquid lubricated conditions using a pin-on-disc wear test apparatus . 
Wear surfaces and debris were examined by scanning electron microscopy . 
Under both dry and partially liquid lubricated conditions , the performance of heat-treated composites was found to be superior to the rest . 
Wear surfaces of heat-treated composites showed the presence of patchy layers of graphite . 
The role of silicon morphology in the formation of triboinduced graphite films is explained.One aim of the experiments carried out in the GFQ during the German Spacelab Mission D1 was to study the influence of convection on the coarsening of secondary dendrite arm spacing in an AlSi 7.0 alloy during normal crystallization at constant velocities v SF and the temperature gradient G SF with quenching of the residual melt . 
When , under μg and 1 g conditions , the same temperature gradient G SF ≈ 16 K/mm and two different velocities ( 5 and 8 mm/min ) were used , dendrite arm coarsening was shown to be lower than in the 1 g reference experiments at v SF ≈ 5 mm/min and nearly identical with the reference results at v SF ≈ 8 mm/min . 
A separation of the different kinds of convection , gravity-driven convection and convection driven by the volume jump , was tried using the coarsening factor M. The influence of gravity convection on the dendrite spacings seems to be high , if the velocity of crystallization is low . 
This influence fades away , if the velocity is high ( e.g . 
, > 8 mm/min ) . 
Porosity in the die casting process causes costly scrap loss and limits the use of die-cast parts in critical high-strength applications . 
The amount of porosity is closely related to the die casting process parameters . 
Consequently , the mechanisms of porosity formation in relation to die casting parameters have to be studied in detail . 
The effect of Sc on precipitation hardening of AlSi6Mg was studied . 
Zr was previously reported that it increased the effectiveness of Sc in wrought aluminum in many areas so Zr was also used together with Sc in this study . 
Different levels of Sc and Zr additions were added to AlSi6Mg before casting in the permanent mold . 
The samples were precipitation hardened at different aging temperatures and for various aging time before testing for tensile strength and hardness . 
It was found that Sc addition into Al6SiMg can change its response to age hardening . 
Additions of Sc and Sc with Zr increased both yield strength and hardness for both aging temperatures . 
In addition , Sc was found to modify eutectic Si to obtain fibrous morphology . 
This effect of Sc on eutectic silicon modification has never been reported before.Recent trends in engine design aimed at increasing fuel efficiency , lowering emissions , and reducing size all tend to increase the thermo-mechanical loads seen by cylinder heads . 
Among several approaches which can be used to combat this problem , the use of new alloys with improved elevated temperature properties ( namely tensile and creep strengths ) is a promising one.In a previous paper , 1 an AlSi7Cu3Mn alloy reinforced by a combination of the peritectic forming elements V , Zr , and Ti was described . 
This Mg-free alloy , heat treated to a T7 temper , offered an interesting combination of elevated temperature and creep strength but suffered from a relatively low room temperature yield strength and poor low cycle fatigue strength . 
Hence R & D work was pursued to improve these properties . 
The present paper describes the final optimized alloy that has evolved out of this work . 
Adding a small amount of Mg has strongly improved the room temperature properties as well as the creep strength , while allowing the amount of V needed to be reduced without undo loss in creep strength . 
The 250 to 350C ( 482–572F ) tensile and creep properties of the new alloy are vastly superior to those of the existing Al-Si alloys currently used for cylinder heads . 
Oxidation films were prepared on ZAlSi12 alloy surfaces by micro-arc oxidation ( MAO ) . 
The effect of Li2SO4 addition into the electrolyte on the performance of the oxidation films was investigated by thickness measurement , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , and electrochemical test.It is found that the oxidation film thickens and coarsens with increasing Li2SO4 content.The results of XRD analysis indicate that the oxidation film is mainly composed of A12O3 phase and mullite phase.Compared with untreated ZAlSi12 alloy samples , the samples treated by micro-arc oxidation with Li2SO4 addition have a better corrosion resistance.Laser surface remelting of hyper-eutectic Al20 and 30 mass % Si cast alloys with CO 2 laser beam has been fined to improve the wear resistance of these alloys . 
A continuous wave CO 2 laser beam with the power of 5kW was irradiated on these AlSi cast alloy substrates under various defocused distance of laser beam with the argon gas shielding . 
The microstructure of the laser-remelted layer consisted of fine primary Si particles , primary α-Al matrix phase and fine α-AlSi eutectic phase . 
The size of the primary Si particle decreased from 25 to 3 μm with the defocused distance also decreasing . 
Fine primary Si particles were distributed uniformly in the matrix of the fully remelted layer . 
The hardness of the laser remelted layer increased gradually with the decrease of the primary Si particle size , which reached 140 HV at about 5 μm in Al30 mass % Si layer . 
The wear resistance of the remelted layer increased with increasing the hardness and decreasing the size of primary Si particle . 
The wear resistance of the remelted layer in Al30 mass % Si cast alloy was better than that of the Al20 mass % Si cast alloy.The effect of Y contents on the high temperature mechanical properties of AlSi7Cu2Mg alloys was investigated by electronic universal material testing machine , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and differential thermal analysis ( DTA ) .The results indicate that the ultimate tensile strength and elongation of the AlSi7Cu2Mg alloy with 0.15 % Y ( mass fraction ) decrease with increasing temperature.The ultimate tensile strength , yield strength and elongation of the AlSi7Cu2Mg alloys with 0.1 % Y increase up to the maximum value and then decrease with increasing Y content at 250 ℃.The alloy with 0.1 % Y has the highest high temperature mechanical properties ( ultimate tensile strength of 275 MPa , yield strength of 240 MPa and elongation of 12.4 % ) .The strengthening effect of trace Y on the AlSi7Cu2Mg alloys is mainly relying on the modification of eutectic Si phase , the optimal modification of Si phase can be obtained with 0.1 % Y.Not AvailableIn order to research the effect of Na2WO4 concentration on characteristics of microarc oxidation ceramic film , ZAlSi12Cu2Mg1 alloy was treated by using microarc oxidation at four sodium tungstate concentrations.Surface morphologies and elements of the ceramic film were studied by scanning electron microscope and energy spectrometer.The thickness , hardness and polarization curve of the ceramic film were tested.The results show that weight of tungsten increases from 1.25 % to 3.52 % with the sodium tungstate concentration increasing.The number of pores on ceramic surface is reduced and the diameter of the pore increases.Surface of the ceramic film becomes smooth.Thickness and hardness of the film increase , while the corrosion resistance declined with the concentration increasing.Na2WO2 g/L is the best.Planar-randomly oriented alumina short fiber ( Saffil ) reinforced Al Si ( LM 13 ) alloy metal matrix composites ( MMCs ) were produced by a modified liquid infiltration technique . 
The wear and friction behavior of LM 13 alloys containing up to 30 vol % Al 2 O 3 fiber were investigated in sliding against a hard steel counterface ( 63 HRC ) by continuous loading experiments carried out in a pin-on-disk machine under dry conditions at room temperature in the transverse section of the composites . 
Sliding tests were conducted at five loads ( 5 N , 10 N , 20 N , 40 N and 60 N ) and under a constant sliding speed of 1 m/s . 
The wear and coefficient of friction against sliding distance initially showed a short transient period and then reached a steady state behavior . 
The wear behavior of the composites was dependent on fiber volume and applied load . 
The wear rate decreased with increased volume fraction of fiber and increased with increasing load . 
The wear resistance of the composites over the range of loads and volume fraction of fibers studied was found to range from almost 1.2 to about 4.0 times that of unreinforced alloy . 
Coefficient of friction decreased with increased fiber volume percent and applied normal load . 
To analyze wear mechanisms , wear surfaces were examined by scanning electron microscopy and it was found that the wear of the unreinforced alloy and composites occurred by groove formation and its subsequent growth , the magnitude of which increased with increasing fiber volume and applied normal load.Filling via-holes with metal films is one of the most important processes for the development of a multi-level metallisation system . 
By employing RF bias sputtering , vias of different feature sizes were filled with AlSi films . 
The process of via-hole filling and the effect of substrate voltage is described . 
The surface topography and cross section of the filled via-holes are shown . 
A two-level metal interconnection structure using sputtered AlSi was fabricated . 
The structure was characterized for the intra-level and inter-level shorts and the continuity of via chains . 
The process is described and the results are presented Characterization of systems with comparable topography but different microstructures . 
Characterization of subsurface shear with platinum markers.•Identification of different volumes relevant for friction and wear . 
Explanation of observed differences with subsurface plastic deformation behavior . 
Aluminium-silicon alloy ( Al-5 % Si-0.2 % Mg ) based composites containing different volume fractions of reinforcing SiC particles are produced using the compocasting route . 
The particles of SiC were incorporated by a special stirrer and the slurry was poured into a permanent die of certain dimensions , preheated to various temperatures , in order to obtain different cooling rates during the solidification of the composite ingots . 
The microstructural characteristics such as dendrite arm spacing , SiC particle distribution , porosity and phases present in the microstructures of the composites were investigated by using light microscope , scanning electron microscope with microprobe attachment and X-ray diffractometer . 
High incorporation levels were obtained by using reasonably short mixing times . 
The ingots cast into moulds having temperatures of 80degC and below showed homogeneous SiC particle distribution . 
The samples with SiC volume fraction lower than 17 % contained little porosity , and no formation of harmful Al4C3 was observed in any of the samples produced Polycrystalline material of various grain sizes of AlSi-alloy containing second-phase particles have been deformed at room temperature in axisymmetric compression . 
The variation in crystallographic orientation in the as-deformed material was obtained by the electron back scattered pattern ( EBSP ) technique in SEM . 
ldquoRandomrdquo and cumulative long range misorientation gradients have been quantified within the matrix ( M ) and at heterogeneities such as the grain boundary ( GB ) , the triple line region ( TL ) and in the vicinity of large second phase particles ( P ) in material compressed to equivalent plastic strains of 0.2 and 0.4 . 
It is shown that the misorientation gradient increases differently in different regions with increasing strain . 
Maximum values were found in regions expected to be more strained than average in order to accommodate imposed constraint from neighbouring grains or from the presence of large second phase particles . 
An important feature of the deformed structure seems to be the cumulative rotation of the lattice about an axis close to the lang111rang-axis in regions with large misorientations . 
The processes of water floW in unsaturated zones are highly nonlinear and subject to either atmosphere control or soil control , often switching from one to the other . 
Such complicated processes arc explored in this paper by examining some limiting analytical solutions of the Richards ' equation . 
This leads to the proposal for future research of a hybrid scheme for solving the Richards ' equation . 
The treatment of spatial variability is also briefly discussed.Surface features , roughness and reflectivity of AlSi alloy thin films deposited by RF sputtering at different voltages is studied for IC metallisationThe aim of this paper was to study the interface reaction between an AlSi alloy reinforced with Ni coated Multi-Wall Carbon Nanotubes ( MWCNTs ) . 
A powder metallurgy processing route was used to produce AlSi composites . 
SEM , DSC , XRD and TEM analysis showed the formation of Al3Ni due to the presence of Al from AlSi matrix and Ni from CNT coating . 
This contributes to stress transfer from matrix to CNT reinforcement and consequently to enhancement of mechanical properties of the composites . 
Also it was observed some dissolution of Ni to AlSi and that the CNTs are very stable as they maintain their integrity . 
The coating of CNTs seems to be a good solution for application of this reinforcement in commercial alloys . 
A moderately deformed polycrystalline AlSi alloy of initially random texture whose deformation structure is discussed in an accompanying paper was annealed until partial recrystallisation . 
The nucleation of recrystallised grains occurred preferentially in regions of large misorientation gradients . 
Particularly potent regions were shown to be the grain boundary and triple line regions , and the regions close to individual second phase particles or clusters of such particles . 
It was found that a majority of the recrystallised grains were developed in regions where a cumulative rotation of the lattice about a ( 111 ) -axis occurred . 
The angle of rotation about a ( 111 ) -axis of grains relative to the surrounding matrix was in the range 35-45deg for about 50 % of these cases . 
The preferred selection of recrystallised grains having the ~40deg ( 111 ) orientation relationship is suggested to be due to the easy formation of such sites in the deformed matrix and also to their preferential growth potential-compromise between the frequency of available nuclei and their respective growth velocities . 
Contact resistance characteristics of n + Si shallow junctions metallized by sputtering an AlSi2 % alloy were investigated for different contact window sizes varying from 2 to 8 mum .

Through testing and analyzing the microstructures of aluminum alloy castings under different solidification pressure , the effect of different solidification pressure on the secondary dendrite arm spacing and grain size is studied . 
Based on the changing characters of pressure and flow velocity during filling process of semi-solid AlSi15Cu3MgFe slurry , the equation , boundary conditions and mathematical model of apparent viscosity were confirmed , and the mold filling equation coupled with the apparent viscosity was established . 
The flowing and filling characteristics of the semi-solid aluminum alloy were compared with the liquid aluminum alloy . 
The results indicate that apparent viscosity decreases with the increase of shear rate , so semi-solid alloy shows shearing thinning thixotropy . 
The steady filling process of semi-solid aluminum alloy is validated by the simulation on semi-solid thixofilling for the two representative semi-solid aluminum castings.A varying content of Li2CO3 was added into Na2SiO3+NaOH system base electrolyte.The micro-arc oxidation ceramic coatings were prepared on the surface of ZAlSi12Cu2Mg1 alloy in the electrolytes and the coatings were characterized by vortex thickness gauge , XRD , SEM and EDS in this work.The results show that the thickness of oxide film increases from 71 μm to 126 μm with increasing of the content of Li2CO3 from 4.0 to 6.0 g/L.The reverse current decreases with increasing of the oxidation time in the MAO process , and the rate of current decrease accelerates with increasing of the content of Li2CO3.It is found by SEM that the roughness of film decrease and then rise , but the size of microspore increase on the surfaces of the film.It is found by XRD that the oxide films were mainly composed of Mullite and Al2O3.The results of EDS analysis indicate that the distribution of chemical elements of the film surface are mainly O , Al and Si , as well as a trace amount of Na and Mg.ZAlSi12Cu2Mg1 alloy was pre-heat treated by T1 and T6 process , respectively , and then the microarc oxidation coating was prepared on the pre-heat treated alloy by microarc oxidation process in NaOH-Na_2SiO_3 electrolyte.The microstructure and properties of oxidation coating were investigated.The electric vortex thickness indicater was employed to measure the thickness of the oxidation coatings.The microhardness and cross-sectional microstructure of oxidation coatings were tested and observed by microhardness tester.The phases of coatings were analyzed by XRD.The results show that pre-heat treatment of the alloy before microarc oxidation process have important effects on the microarc oxidation.The thick oxidation coatings are obtained on the pre-heat treated ZAlSi12Cu2Mg1 alloy.The coating with good binding with substrate mainly consists of α-Al_2O_3 , γ-Al_2O_3 , Al , Al_2SiO_5 and amorphous phase.The microstructure and property of oxidation coatings of the alloy pre-heat treated by T6 process are better than that of the alloy pre-heat treated by T1 . 
The effects of Strontium ( Sr ) , Iron ( Fe ) and Manganese ( Mn ) additions , casting process ( i.e. , cooling rate ) on the microstructures and mechanical properties of AlSi7Cu3 alloy were investigated . 
2D and 3D metallographic and image analysis have been performed to measure the microstructural changes occurring at different Sr , Fe and Mn levels and casting process . 
The evolution of mechanical properties of the alloys has been monitored by Brinell and Vickers hardness measurement and tensile tests . 
Addition of Sr slightly refines the eutectic silicon particles but it also introduces more pores . 
The combined addition of Fe and Mn induces an increase of Fe-rich intermetallic compounds which include both α-Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 and β-Al5FeSi phase , while the volume fraction of porosity decreases with the Fe and Mn content increase . 
The secondary dendrite arm spacing slightly decreases with the addition of Sr , Fe and Mn alloying elements.The formation of MAO ceramic coating on ZAlSi12Cu2Mg1 alloy was observed in electrolyte which is composed of NaSiO3 , Na2WO4 , NaOH , glycerin and Na2EDTA . 
Effects of different proportions on critical arc starting voltage , stable oxidation time , the forming rate and hardness of coating were analyzed . 
The results show that NaSiO3 and NaOH can evidently promote the formation of coating , and the Na2WO4 can improve the hardness of coating . 
Meanwhile , NaOH can decrease the critical arc-starting voltage , and glycerin and Na2EDTA can increase stable oxidation time and improve the stability of MAO . 
Microstructural observation reveal that the wear resistance of the ceramic coating can be evidently improved in glycerin and Na2EDTA electrolyte as a result of refining ceramic particle in coating and improving the bonding condition of coating and matrix alloy.The interactive effects of cooling rate and hydrogen content on refinement of primary silicon in hypereutectic Al Si alloy were studied by HYSCANⅡ hydrogen tester and multi stepped specimens . 
The results showed that both hydrogen content in melt and cooling rate exhibited mutually stimulative interactive effects on refinement of the primary silicon . 
Refinement effects on primary silicon were stable and independent on hydrogen content and cooling rate with less than 0.2 mL/100 g and 0.144 k/s ( equivalent to 50 mm thickness of the specimens ) in sand casting respectively . 
Average size of the primary silicon is approximately 18 μm.The thixoforming mechanical behavior of the semi-solid AlSi7Mg alloy was studied on the Gleeble-1500 material thermo-simulation machine . 
The viscoplastic model of the stress at different temperatures was set up through the regression analysis . 
The experimental results made on the semi-solid metal thixoforming apparatus were compared with the simulation results calculated through DEFORM ? software . 
It is shown that the model is reasonable , and the simulated results are in agreement with experimental ones.In order to suit the need of the nationalization car production , a new type of cast alloy AlSi_7Cu_2Mg was developed to replace the AC4B Al-Si alloy of JIS and 328.0 alloy of AA . 
The T7 heat treatment cycle was tested .

It exceeds the mechanical properties of AC4B and 328.0 under the same condition , and its dimension is more stable . 
At present , the alloy has been used to produce the cylinder cover of the car , and it will be more widely used in producing automobile parts.The effect of different pouring temperatures on the microstructures of A1Si_7Mg alloy has been researched . 
When the pouring temperature is close to the liquidus temperature of A1Si_7Mg alloy , the primary α-A1 in the billets of A1Si_s7Mg alloy solidifies into spherical or nodular grains which are small and distributed homogeneously . 
In order to obtain non-dendritic semi-solid billets , the appropriate pouring temperature is 615℃ . 
The faster cooling rate , the melt flowing and larger solidification region induced by the near liquidus pouring temperature promotes the formation of spherical or nodular primal α-A1.Recently , an innovative AlSi3Mg alloy with Cr and Mn additions was developed for the production of truck wheels by means of a non-conventional hybrid technique , which combines features of both low pressure die casting and forging processes . 
The presence of both Cr and Mn leads to the formation of an intermetallic phase rich in Cr , Mn and Fe with a globular or dendritic morphology . 
Furthermore , proper solution treatments cause the formation of dispersoids in the aluminium matrix . 
These dispersoids are responsible of enhancing the alloy performance due to dispersion hardening mechanism . 
In the present work , the tensile properties and the impact toughness of the alloy in as-cast and different heat-treated conditions were studied . 
Moreover , tensile and impact strength tests were performed on A356 samples in T6 condition machined from traditional LPDC wheels , whose results were compared with the performance of the innovative alloy . 
Fracture surfaces of tensile and Charpy specimens were observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy ( SEM ) in order to identify the role of the Cr-Mn containing intermetallic particles in the failure mechanism and the influence of the heat treatment parameters . 
Considering the static properties , the innovative alloy showed remarkable values of tensile strength , while ductility was improved only after heat treatment optimization . 
Poor impact toughness values were measured and the microstructural analysis confirmed the presence of coarse intermetallic secondary phases , acting as crack initiation and propagation particles , on the fracture surfaces.comparison of processing of atomized and spray deposited alsifeni alloy : e hehmann , et al , ( ecole des mines de paris , france ) . 
vol 1 , paper 8 , 216–226In the present work , laser beam build-up welding of AlSi12 alloy powder on AlSi1MgMn-alloy ( EN AW-6082 ) substrate has been studied to determine the laser deposition strategy for fabrication of 3-D ... The homogenization of AlSi7MgCu0.5 alloy as-cast structure by using an equal channel angular pressing ( ECAP ) was investigated . 
The heat treatment of as-cast alloy applied before ECAP processing was required to increase alloy plasticity . 
Therefore , the samples of analyzed alloy were solution annealed at temperature of 550 degC for 4 hours and subsequently water quenched . 
Quenched samples were artificially aged at temperature of 300 degC for 5 hours to obtain an over-aged alloy state . 
The solution annealing of as-cast alloy state caused a partial spheroidization and coarsening of eutectic Si-particles . 
During artificial aging of analyzed alloy , the incoherent particles precipitated uniformly from alpha-solid solution . 
The ECAP technique at room temperature homogenized its heterogeneous dendritic microstructure and formed the ultra-fine grains of solid solution . 
A redistribution and fragmentation of the eutectic Si-particles and precipitated particles was occurred.TiNi/Al-12 % Si alloy is a kind of prospective material used as special energy absorbers for eliminating undesirable noise and mechanical vibration . 
The investigation on the mechanical properties of this composite alloy is of great importance . 
In this study , the surface deformation of TiNi/Al-12 % Si composite alloy under external loading was measured experimentally by means of DSCM method . 
Some deformation characteristics of TiNi/AISi composite alloy under the effect of the tensile load and the interaction between TiNi and AISi are discussed . 
In addition , the elastic modulus and the poisson 's ratio of this alloy were measured as well . 
The results agrees well with the theory predicts.This paper has studied the influence of low level of La ( RE ) on Sr-modified structure of Al-Si7Cu2Mg cast alloy.The interaction between La ( RE elements ) and Sr has been analyzed with electronicprobe , to be found to form a complex compound containing Sr , La etc.elements.It decrease Sr effectivemodification level , resulting in some effects on Sr-modified structure.The paper presents research on the effects of soft annealing parameters on a change of the impact strength KC and Brinell hardness ( HB ) of the EN AC-AlSi11 alloy . 
The research has been performed according to the trivalent testing plan for two input parameters – temperature in the range between 280°C and 370°C and time in the range between 2 and 8 hours . 
The application of such heat treatment improves the plasticity of the investigated alloy . 
The improvement of the impact strength KC by 71 % and the decrease of the hardness HB by 20 % was achieved for the soft annealing treatment conducted at a temperature 370°C for 8 hours , compared to the alloy without the heat treatment . 
A change of the form of eutectic silicon precipitations which underwent refinement , coagulation and partial rounding , had a direct effect on the hardness HB and impact strength KC . 
The results obtained were used to prepare space plots enabling the temperature and time for soft annealing treatment to be selected with reference to the obtained impact strength KC and hardness HB of the alloy with the heat treatment . 
Primary AlSi10MnMg alloy is the most widely used alloy for manufacturing of vacuum assisted high pressure die castings ( VPDC ) with high ductility requirements . 
In this alloy , die soldering is avoided by a high Mn level ( 0.5 - 0.6 wt . 
% ) while Fe is kept low ( < 0.25 wt . 
% ) . 
Such combination guarantees that the Al-Fe-Mn-Si intermetallic compounds are of the α-iron rich polyhedral or Chinese script type , which is less harmful to the ductility . 
However , secondary alloys are cheaper and their production requires less energy than the one of primary alloys . 
The higher amount of Fe , a common impurity in secondary alloys , reduces ductility but also die soldering and thus manufacturing costs . 
Microadditions based on Mn are known to be very effective in transforming the harmful needle/platelet shaped < i > β < /i > -compounds into < i > α < /i > -iron compounds with a less harmful morphology . 
In this work a secondary alloy with 0.60 wt . 
% Fe and different Mn microadditions has been cast in test parts with different wall thicknesses using VPDC technology . 
The Mn content of the new alloy has been optimized . 
Mechanical properties of the optimised alloy have been determined in different heat treatment conditions and been compared to the corresponding AlSi10MnMg primary alloy . 
Mechanical properties similar to those of the primary alloy have been achieved . 
The microstructure and mechanical properties of the novel AlSi11CuMn alloy manufactured by selective laser melting were investigated in the as processed state and after heat treatment . 
A fine eutectic structure formed in the as processed alloy . 
A duplex size structure formed after solution treatment . 
The thermal expansion coefficient was 19.1∙10 -6 °C -1 in the 20-100°C range which is typical for cast Al-Si alloys . 
Increasing annealing temperature from 190 to 275 °C leads to a sharp decrease in the alloy hardness from 136HV to 119HV after 2.5h . 
The hardness was significantly reduced from 136HV to 79-82HV after solution treatment at 515 °C . 
The yield stress , ultimate tensile strength and elongation were 288MPa , 354MPa and 5.4 % , respectively after solution treatment at 515°C and aging at 180°C for 8h.The effect of different pouring temperatures and different pouring heights , the distance between the mouth of the pouring ladle and the top of the mold , on the microstructure of AlSi7Mg alloy have been researched in the paper . 
When the pouring temperature is close to the liquidus temperature , the primary α-Al in'the billets of AlSi7Mg alloy solidified into spherical and nodular fine grains distributed homogeneously . 
The optimum pouring temperature for semi-solid AlSi7Mg billet with spherical or nodular primary c-Al is 615℃ . 
At the same pouring temperature , the higher the pouring ladle , the more easily the spherical and nodular primary α-Al obtained in the semi-solid AlSi7Mg billet . 
When the pouring temperature is close to the liquidus temperature and the pouring ladle is relatively high , it is the great cooling rate , the flow of the molten alloy caused by pouring and the large simultaneous solidification region induced by the near liquidus temperature , that promote the formation of spherical or nodular primary c-Al . 
In the present work , the rheological model ( CF model ) developed by Chen and Fan [ 1 ] for semisolid metal slurries ( SSMS ) is applied to investigate the thixotropy of the AlSi6Mg2 alloy under cyclic shear deformation . 
The present investigation indicates that the semisolid AlSi6Mg2 alloy has the thixotropy by the technique of hysteresis loop . 
Specifically , the area of the hysteresis loop increases with decreasing the up-time , the initial shear rate and increasing resting time , solid volume fraction and maximum shear rate , respectively . 
These results agree qualitatively with the experimental data . 
Furthermore , the origin of the hysteresis loop is attributed to the difference between the agglomeration rate and the deagglomeration rate.The changes in the microstructure and improvement in the mechanical properties of as-cast AlSi7MgCu0.5 alloy induced by the heat treatment and technique of equal channel angular pressing ( ECAP ) were investigated . 
The heat treatment of as-cast alloy performed before the ECAP technique was required to increase the plasticity of the alloy . 
Therefore , the samples of analysed alloys were solution annealed at optimized temperature of 823 K for 4 hours to dissolve the particles of intermetallic π ( Al8FeMg3Si6 ) phase and to spheroidize the Si particles . 
Subsequently , water quenching and artificial ageing at optimized temperature of 573 K for 5 hours was used to obtain an overaged alloy state . 
The microstructure of alloy was consisted of α ( Al ) solid solution , eutectic Si particles , and intermetallic β ( Mg2Si ) , Q-Al4Mg5Si4Cu , α-Al12 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si , and/or α-Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 phase particles . 
The crystal structure of present phases was confirmed by hard X-ray diffraction at Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron ( DESY ) in Hamburg and by the selected area electron diffraction ( SAED ) performed inside the transmission electron microscope ( TEM ) . 
The heat-treated alloy was processed by ECAP at room temperature following route A . 
Repetitive ECAP of alloy homogenized the heterogeneous as-cast microstructure and formed the ultrafine subgrain microstructure with elongated subgrains of 0.2 µm in width and 0.65 µm in length and the high dislocation density . 
Microstructural changes in alloy induced by both heat treatment and ECAP led to the high strain hardening of the alloy that appeared in an improvement in strength , ductility , and microhardness of alloy in comparison with as-cast alloy state.\0SSM ( Semi-solid metal ) forming has been developed to become a novel technology in the 21st century for the formation of near net shape components , competing with conventional casting and forging technologies . 
In this paper , the casting microstructure and its change during remelting of AlSi7Cu5 alloy casting by slope near-liquidus method were researched . 
Experiments show that it has a significant impact on microstructure by cooling method , the thermal conductivity of the casting mold and casting method . 
The microstructure of AlSi7Cu5 alloy obtained by slope near-liquidus method at 600℃ is uniform and small equiaxed Its average grain diameter is about 55.2um , and its average grain size roundness is about 2.13 . 
The reheated microstructure which can be applied in thixo-forming preferable will be obtained by keeping constant temperature 25min at 580℃.In the present work , basing on the rheological model of Chen and Fan [ 1 ] , the rheological behavior of AlSi6Mg2 alloy at transient state is investigated . 
It has been shown that the deagglomeration of particles is about two orders of magnitude faster than the agglomeration of them . 
The inequality of agglomeration rate and deagglomeration rate is thought as the origin of the thixotropy of SSMS . 
Subsequently , the similar trend of the variation of the viscosity and the average agglomerate size with shearing time and resting time shows that the microstructure of SSMS determines its rheological behavior , while the external flow conditions ( such as shear rate , shearing time , etc ) influence the viscosity by changing its microstructure . 
The present study predicts that the CF model can describe reliably the transient rheological behavior of AlSi6Mg2 alloy.AlSi7Mg0.35 alloy was cast into permanent moulds using different pouring temperatures ( 725 to 625 deg C ) . 
As the pouring temperature decreased , the as-cast microstructure changed from a coarse dendritic structure , through fine equiaxed grains to fine % rosette-like grains . 
the as-cast materials were then partially remelted and isothermally held at 580 deg C prior to semisolid casting into a stepped die . 
The feedstock material cast from a high temperature filled only half the die , with severe segregation and other defects . 
The low-temperature-poured material completely filled the die with negligible porosity . 
The quality of semisolid castings is significantly affected by the microstructure of the semisolid feedstock material that arises from a combination of as-cast and subsequent thermal treatment conditions . 
The paper describes ( a ) the influence of pouring temperature on the microstructure of feedstock ; ( b ) microstructure evolution through remelting and ( c ) the quality of semisolid casting produced with this material . 
For Al7Si0.35Mg alloy , low temperature pouring in the range of 625-650 deg C followed by suitable isothermal holding treatment can result in good quality semisolid casting.The transformation from solid to liquid and the structure evolution of primary alpha crystals of AlSi6.5Cu2.8Mg alloy were investigated in semi-solid remelting condition . 
Results show that the structure evolution of the alloy consists of three stages : liquid increasing , composition change of liquid from eutectic to hypoeutectic , and uniformity of hypoeutectic liquid . 
The alpha crystals grow in forms of the coalescence and the collision-amalgamation in the first and second stages and in the form of Ostwald ripening in the third stage . 
It was found from statistical analysis that ( 1 ) the power exponent in the parabolic function relation between alpha crystal diameter and remelting time changes with remelting temperatures , ( 2 ) the exponents with respect to remelting temperatures of 573degC , 578degC and 584degC are 4.004 , 2.38 and 1.84 , respectively , and ( 3 ) convection intensity in the semi-solid melt is a main factor to influence these exponents . 
It is found in this investigation that there is another mechanism of coalescence growth , which is responsible for the high exponent at low temperature . 
And at high temperature , the minimum value of the exponent is 1 ( due to ) Ostwald ripening growthTernary Al-6.5wt. % Si-0.93wt. % Fe alloy samples were directionally solidified on-board of the International Space Station ISS in the ESA payload Materials Science Laboratory ( MSL ) equipped with Low Gradient Furnace ( LGF ) under both purely diffusive and stimulated convective conditions induced by a rotating magnetic field . 
Using different analysis techniques the shape and distribution of the intermetallic phase β-Al5SiFe in the dendritic microstructure was investigated , to study the influence of solidification velocity and fluid flow on the size and spatial arrangement of intermetallics . 
Deep etching as well as 3-dimensional computer tomography measurements characterized the size and the shape of β-Al5SiFe platelets : Diffusive growth results in a rather homogeneous distribution of intermetallic phases , whereas forced flow promotes an increase in the amount and the size of β-Al5SiFe platelets in the centre region of the samples . 
The β-Al5SiFe intermetallics can form not only simple platelets , but also be curved , branched , crossed , interacting with dendrites and porosity located . 
This leads to formation of large and complex groups of Fe-rich intermetallics , which reduce the melt flow between dendrites leading to lower permeability of the mushy zone and might significantly decrease feeding ability in castings . 
The internal architecture of an AlSi12CuMgNi piston alloy , revealed by synchrotron tomography , consists of three dimensional interconnected hybrid networks of Cu-rich aluminides , Mg-rich aluminides and eutectic/primary Si embedded in an alpha-Al matrix . 
The strength at room temperature and at 300degC is studied as a function of solution treatment time at 490degC and compared with results previously reported for an AlSi12Ni alloy . 
The addition of 1 wt % Cu and 1 wt % Mg to AlSi12CuMgNi increases the room temperature strength by precipitation hardening while the strength at 300degC is similar for both alloys in as-cast condition . 
The strength of AlSi12CuMgNi decreases with solution treatment time and stabilizes at 4 h solution treatment . 
The effect of solution treatment time on the strength of the AlSi12CuMgNi alloy is less pronounced than for the AlSi12Ni alloy both at room temperature and at 300degC . 
[ All rights reserved Elsevier ] .Abstract Rapid melt pool formation and solidification during the metal powder bed process Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) generates large thermal gradients that can in turn lead to increased residual stress formation within a component . 
Metal anchors or supports are required to be built in-situ and forcibly hold SLM structures in place and minimise geometric distortion/warpage as a result of this thermal residual stress . 
Anchors are often costly , difficult and time consuming to remove and limit the geometric freedom of this Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) process . 
A novel method known as Anchorless Selective Laser Melting ( ASLM ) maintains processed material within a stress relieved state throughout the duration of a build . 
As a result metal components formed using ASLM do not require support structures or anchors . 
ASLM locally melts two or more powdered materials that alloy under the action of the laser and can form into various combinations of eutectic/hypo/hyper eutectic alloys with a new lower solidification temperature . 
This new alloy is maintained in a semi-solid or stress reduced state throughout the build with the assistance of elevated powder bed pre-heating . 
In this paper the ASLM methodology is detailed and investigations into processing of a low temperature eutectic Al-Si binary casting alloy is explored . 
Two types of Al powders were compared ; pre-alloyed AlSi12 and elemental mix Al & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; 12 & nbsp ; wt % Si . 
The study established an understanding of the laser in-situ alloying process and confirmed successful alloy formation within the process . 
Differential thermal analysis , microscopy and X-Ray diffraction were used to further understand the nature of alloying within the process . 
Residual stress reduction was observed within ASLM processed elemental Al & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; Si12 and geometries produced without the requirement for anchors.The paper presents fatigue tests ( unilateral pulsating vibrations ) for hypereutectic silumin AlSi17Cu5Mg aimed at simulation of deflection of the piston head in a combustion engine . 
The methodology of the tests and the way of marking the deflection of the tested material is described together with the detailed description of the test stand . 
The paper presents tests determining the influence of modification with phosphorus and fast cooling on the microstructure and friction coefficient of AlSi17Cu5Mg alloy . 
Changes mainly concern the size of primary silicon crystals and stereological parameters in reference to initial material . 
Modification with fast cooling was aimed at achievement of fine-crystalline structure with shapes of silicon crystals close to the spherical shape . 
The consequences of such activities are visible , significant changes in the tribological properties of tested alloy . 
Friction coefficient μ for material subject to fast cooling was on the level of 0.26 and for initial material it equalled 0.29.This paper investigates the micro-strain induced by thermal cycling in short fiber reinforced AlSi12CuMgNi piston alloy and AE42 magnesium alloy . 
Samples of KS125reg alloy and its composites are subjected to thermal cycling in a temperature range from 58 plusmn 2 to 287 plusmn 5degC with heating and cooling rate of 10degC/min . 
On the other hand , samples of AE42 alloy and its composite are cycled up to 20 cycles in a temperature range from 30 to 340degC with heating and cooling rate of 5degC/min . 
The investigations on thermal strain response are performed using an alumina tube dilatomerThe investigations results concern the influence of laser heat treatment on the structure and mechanical properties of aluminium alloy , where the mutual relationships were tested and presented in this paper . 
The aim of this investigations was to improve the mechanical and wear resistance properties of the top surface layers of the aluminium alloy AlSi12CuNiMg by remelting and feeding the tungsten carbide powder in to the molten material and next quick solidification . 
The powder of tungsten carbide has been introduced in the liquid metal using gravity feeder at a constant rate of 3 g/min . 
In order to remelting the aluminium alloy surface , there has been used the high power diode laser HPDL , with an applied power of the laser beam in the range between 1.6 kW and 2.0 kW . 
The linear laser scan rate of the beam was set as much as 0.4 m/min . 
As a result of laser treatment of aluminium alloy a composite layer with higher hardness and enhanced wear resistance compared to the base material has been obtained.Burr formation during machining is an important issue in industry . 
It causes an additional deburring operation , which is time consuming and has a negative economic impact.This study aims to analyse burr formation mechanisms and its accumulation in successive passes during orthogonal cutting of a cast aluminium alloy . 
A customized experimental setup was developed , which includes a high speed imaging system and a laser profilometer . 
A design of experiments using the setup mentioned previously is carried out and a methodology for geometric burr characterization is developed and applied . 
Furthermore , statistical representation of the obtained results is performed , which allows the understanding of the geometric heterogeneity influence associated to burr formation mechanisms and to work material microstructure.Based on the exit burr analysis , new geometrical criteria are proposed for the characterisation and the definition of two main burr formation mechanisms.The influence of cutting parameters on burr morphology along the workpiece exit edge is investigated in depth . 
The results show that two types of burrs can be produced simultaneously along the workpiece exit edge due to the work material microstructure heterogeneity . 
The results present as well the influence of low uncut chip thickness that leads to a higher proportion of burrs without chamfer . 
This type of burr is higher and more propice to burr accumulation . 
After performing several cutting passes , these burrs may be eliminated and replaced by a burr with chamfer . 
The isothermal creep resistance of an overaged AlSi12CuMgNi alloy was studied at 300°C as a function of solution heat treatment time at 480°C . 
The microstructure of the alloy in as cast condition is formed by a three dimensional network of Si lamellae and intermetallic compounds embedded in an age-hardenable α-Al matrix . 
The solution heat treatment provokes the partial dissolution of Mg-rich intermetallic compounds and the spheroidisation of eutectic Si . 
These microstructural changes reduce the creep resistance of the alloy with increasing solution heat treatment time . 
The determination of the load transfer loss during solution heat treatment and an analogy with a modified shear-lag model for metal matrix composites indicate that the largest reduction in creep resistance occurs in the first 20min–1h of solution heat treatment.The influence of Cu on the mechanical properties of AlSi7Mg0.5 alloy after T6 heat treatment has been studied . 
The tensile strength and peak age hardness increase while the elongation decreases with increasing Cu content in the alloy . 
The investigation of the precipitation behavior of dispersoids during aging by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and high resolution TEM shows that Cu addition increases the density of the beta '' precipitates and induces the precipitation of precursors of Q phase at the peak aged condition . 
When the Cu content is high , thetas'-Al 2Cu phase also precipitates during artificial aging . 
[ All rights reserved Elsevier ] The evolution of the microstructure during creep of an AlSi12CuMgNi alloy with 15 vol % of Al 2O 3 short fibres is investigated by means of synchrotron microtomography . 
The results reveal a change of the morphology of the hybrid reinforcement composed of eutectic-Si , short fibres and intermetallic particles . 
This change takes place due to the diffusion induced coarsening of Si and a coarsening of the intermetallic particles . 
The interconnectivity of the hybrid reinforcement increases during long-term creep exposure reaching a degree of almost full interconnectivity after 6400 h of creep . 
The analysis of creep damage during secondary creep stage shows an increase of void volume fraction by a factor 2 , while the number of voids per volume remains practically constant ( void sizes larger than 8 voxels were analysed ) . 
An analysis of the voidspsila location indicates that pores generated during processing of the composite grow , but no new pores are produced during the primary and secondary creep stages . 
[ All rights reserved Elsevier ] .The isothermal creep resistance of AlSi12CuMgNi alloys produced by squeeze casting , unreinforced and reinforced with 10 , 15 and 20vol % of short alumina fibres is investigated by means of long-term tensile creep tests at 300degC . 
Dislocation creep-mechanisms associated with a Norton exponent n=3 are attributed to both the unreinforced and the short fibre reinforced materials ( SFRMs ) in the stress range between 10 and 50 % of the yield strength at 300degC . 
The embedding of short fibres reduces the creep rate of the alloy by more than one order of magnitude . 
The SFRM with 15vol % of reinforcement is the most creep resistant , while the 20vol % SFRM is less creep resistant than the 10 and 15vol % SFRMs due to its higher defect density and larger interface area . 
Load changes are imposed during creep tests to study the influence of periods of overloading . 
Returning to the initial load causes the stationary creep rates of the SFRMs to be further reduced down to one third of their initial values . 
Furthermore , a small increase in the creep exponent n of the SFRMs is observed after an overloading cycle . 
The increase of the connectivity of the Si/Al 2O 3 -short fibre network in the direction of loading enhances the load transfer effect from the matrix to the reinforcement decreasing thus the external stress acting on the matrix . 
The yielding of highly stressed zones in the matrix around the ceramic reinforcement during the overload is able to produce a more uniform distribution of internal stresses when returned to a lower stress level . 
Both effects are considered to be responsible for the observed reduction of the stationary creep rate . 
The unexpected low creep resistance of the 20vol % SFRM in comparison with the two other composites can be explained by the larger number of micro-structural defects ( les1vol % porosity ) found in this material after the infiltration process . 
Although the small portion of these defects does not affect the high temperature tensile properties of the composite , it accelerates the diffusion controlled creep mechanisms . 
The larger interface area present in the materials with higher reinforcement volume fraction increases the diffusivity as well . 
The connectivity of the Si/Al 2O 3-short fibre ( SF ) network is higher for the 20vol % SFRM than for the other SFRMs already before creep exposure . 
Thus the training effect by overloading periods is less efficient in the 20 vol % SFRM than in SFRMs with less fibre content . 
Those effects are counteracted by the fact that the higher the reinforcement volume fraction the smaller the load acting on the matrix . 
Yet for the investigated 20vol % SFRM samples , the negative contributions prevail resulting in a lower creep resistance than for the other two composites . 
[ All rights reserved Elsevier ] Abstract Alternatives to the Standard T6 heat treatment that relied on a 5-h solution heat treatment at 490 °C were investigated in effort to reduce the heat treatment cycle time for the manufacture of AlSi7MgCu0.5 alloy V8 cylinder heads without sacrificing the mechanical properties while providing extra capacity in the heat treatment plant . 
The optimum T6 heat treatment process was identified to be a SHT at 545 °C for 1 h followed by ageing treatment at 180 °C for 3 h. Mechanical properties of the cylinder heads thus manufactured were markedly superior while the total heat treatment duration was reduced by 2.5 h with respect to the Standard heat treatment . 
This implied a capacity increase of % 61 and rendered the undertaking of a major customer order possible.Two composites , consisting of an as-cast AlSi12CuMgNi alloy reinforced with 15 vol % Al2O3 short fibres and with 7 vol % Al2O3 short fibres + 15 vol % SiC particles , were studied . 
Synchrotron computed tomography disclosed distribution , orientation , and volume fraction of the different phases . 
In-situ compression tests during neutron diffraction in direction parallel to the fibres plane revealed the load partition between phases . 
Internal damage ( fragmentation ) of the Si phase and Al2O3 fibres was directly observed in CT reconstructions . 
Significant debonding between Al matrix and SiC particles was also found . 
Finally , based on the Maxwell scheme , a micromechanical model was utilized for the new composite with two-ceramic reinforcements ; it rationalizes the experimental data and predicts the evolution of all internal stress components in each phase.In this study , the impact of surface finishing procedures on the corrosion resistance of an AlSi10Mg_200C alloy manufactured through direct metal laser sintering ( DMLS ) versus its die cast ... Not AvailableThe influence of solution heat treatment time and temperature on the microstructure and mechanical properties and the mode of fracture of a high-pressure die-cast AlSi7MgMn alloy is reported . 
Metallographic and image analysis techniques have been used to quantitatively examine the microstructural changes occurring during solution heat treatment . 
A solution heat treatment of 15 minutes at 475degC , or even more at 525degC , is sufficient to spheroidize the eutectic Si , as well as coarsen and increase the interparticle distance of the eutectic Si . 
Increasing the solutionizing temperature from 475degC to 525degC improves the mechanical properties.In the present work , the cyclic stress response and microstructure evolution of AlSi10Mg ( Cu ) alloy at high temperature were investigated . 
Samples were tested at high temperature , under total strain control and tensile-compression loading ( R = −1 ) until failure . 
The cyclic stress response was analyzed , as well as the microstructures were examined by TEM . 
The results demonstrated that the cycle stress response of the studied alloy is experimental temperature dependence . 
Microstructure analysis indicated the precipitated phase was disruptive changed by high temperature compared to the as-received alloy . 
A lot of coherent β″-Mg 2 Si precipitates and GP zones were observed in the as-received alloy , resulting in sustaining cyclic hardening by pinning effect . 
At high temperature , the vast majority of the tiny coherency precipitates and clusters transformed to the large semi-coherency Q′ and β′-Mg 2 Si precipitates , leading to the sharp decrease of pinning number and the change of dislocation interaction mechanism , which is believed to be one of the reasons for softening . 
Another reason is that high temperatures can promote dislocations movement.The material used in this study was AlSi10Mg alloy powder . 
And the particle morphology , particle size distribution and chemical properties of the aluminum alloy powder were characterized . 
The ... Highlights Statistical design of experiment approach and the energy density model were correlated for SLM of AlSi10Mg alloy . 
The mechanical properties were assessed , including the high temperature creep properties . 
The energy threshold for processing AlSi10Mg alloy are within the range 60–75 & nbsp ; J/mm3 . 
Abstract The influence of selective laser melting ( SLM ) process parameters ( laser power , scan speed , scan spacing , and island size using a Concept Laser M2 system ) on the porosity development in AlSi10Mg alloy builds has been investigated , using statistical design of experimental approach , correlated with the energy density model . 
A two-factor interaction model showed that the laser power , scan speed , and the interaction between the scan speed and scan spacing have the major influence on the porosity development in the builds . 
By driving the statistical method to minimise the porosity fraction , optimum process parameters were obtained . 
The optimum build parameters were validated , and subsequently used to build rod-shaped samples to assess the room temperature and high temperature ( creep ) mechanical properties . 
The samples produced using SLM showed better strength and elongation properties , compared to die cast Al-alloys of similar composition . 
Creep results showed better rupture life than cast alloy , with a good agreement with the Larson–Miller literature data for this alloy composition.Dynamic properties of additively manufactured AlSi10Mg alloy by selective laser melting ( AM–SLM-processed ) have been investigated using the split Hopkinson pressure bar ( SHPB ) system . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) processes have attracted increased attention over the past three decades , and AlSi10Mg is an alloy commonly used in AM processes . 
AlSi10Mg is a widely used material , and has been a subject of extensive investigations concerning its microstructure , quasi-static properties , and post-processing . 
Nonetheless , dynamic mechanical properties of this alloy are yet to be explored over a wide range of strain rates . 
Dynamic properties of X- and Z-oriented AlSi10Mg alloy samples in the as-built and T5 heat-treated ( T5-HT ) states were investigated using SHPB under strain rates varying over a range of 700–7900 s -1 . 
The investigation revealed an important dependence of dynamic properties of the said alloy on build orientation when subjected to strain rates range of the order of 1000–3000 s -1 . 
At values of strain rate above and below this range , the observed dependency no longer existed . 
In addition , dependency of dynamic properties of the alloy on its thermal state ( as-built versus T5-HT state ) was investigated for the first time along with detection of no-strain-rate sensitivity of the AM-SLM-processed AlSi10Mg alloy . 
A pronounced ellipticity was observed in most samples , thereby reflecting the anisotropic nature of the alloy . 
Fractography and optical microscopy analyses revealed differences between fracture morphologies observed in the as-built and T5-HT samples . 
Cracks observed were predominantly of the radial type ( with minor circumferential cracks ) under the brittle fracture mode in as-built samples . 
In contrast , T5-HT samples mainly demonstrated the ductile mode of deformation.This paper presents a study on structural changes occurring in a rapidly quenched metastable AlSi10Mg alloy during heating cycles within the temperature range from room temperature to 800 K. Measurement of electrical resistivity of a ribbon showed that structural stabilization takes place at temperatures ranging from 450 K to 650 K. The isotherms of the electrical resistivity measured at temperatures 473 K , 483 K and 498 K revealed two stages of structural stabilization i.e . 
a kinetic process and diffusion process . 
Measurement of the thermoelectromotive force of the thermocouple made from the investigated alloy and a copper conductor by a mechanical joining was used to determine relative changes in the electron density of states of the quenched sample after successive heat treatments . 
The same alloy sample was subjected to successive heat treatments at temperatures up to 503 K , 643 K , 683 K and 763 K. The change in the thermopower suggested that each heating was followed by an increase in free electron density in the alloy . 
Therefore , the abrupt decline in electrical resistivity was induced by an increase in both the mean free electron path and free electron density during the thermal stabilization of the structure.This study investigates the cavitation erosion resistance of AlSi10Mg additive manufactured samples according to the ASTM G32 standard , in comparison with the cast ones . 
Samples were tested in different conditions in order to analyse the effect of T6 heat treatment and hot isostatic pressing , while cast samples were studied in as-cast and heat-treated conditions . 
It was found that additive manufactured AlSi10Mg alloy shows outstanding cavitation erosion resistance , in comparison to the cast alloy , mainly due to the ultra-fine microstructure . 
This superior performance of as-produced AlSi10Mg additive manufactured samples was demonstrated by the extremely limited mass loss and erosion rate measured during the tests , coupled with a remarkably long incubation stage . 
On the other hand , the heat treatment proves detrimental to the cavitation resistance of additive manufactured material due to the microstructure modification and pores enlargement . 
Hot isostatic pressing only partially improves the alloy performance.The paper deals with the effect of heat treatments on corrosion resistance of an AlSi10Mg alloy obtained by means of Direct Metal Laser Sintering . 
The tests were performed on as-processed alloy and after different post-heat treatment , covering stress relieving , annealing at high temperature and water quenching . 
Potentiodynamic and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests were carried out in aerated Harrison solution . 
The results show localized corrosion and selective penetrating attack at the border of melt pools on untreated or only stress relieved specimens . 
The selective attack was not observed after high temperature annealing . 
Modification of EIS plot evidenced galvanic coupling with silicon coarse particles that extensively precipitate during high temperature annealing . 
The morphology of precipitates is described in order to evidence their relevance in terms of rising selective penetrating attack and galvanic coupling.The dynamic response of selective laser melting ( SLM ) -processed and sand cast Al10SiMg samples were studied in a series of planar impact experiments . 
It was found that the dynamic response of SLM-processed alloys is virtually independent of the processing orientation . 
The dynamic yield strength and tensile ( spall ) strengths of SLM-processed material exceeds those of the cast alloy by factors of two and four , respectively . 
It was found that with increase in the tensile strain rate ε̇t , the fracture mode of SLM-processed material changes from apparently ductile at strain rates below ε̇t≈5×103s−1 to evidently brittle above this threshold . 
At approximately the same strain rate and at shear stress greater than 65 MPa , the mechanism governing the compressive ( yield ) strength of the SLM-processed alloy also changes from thermally-activated passage of obstacles by moving dislocations to dislocation over-barrier glide controlled by phonon viscous drag.The additive manufacture ( AM ) of the AlSi10Mg alloy has become the subject of considerable attention , especially for production of complex parts in engines . 
Because such parts can be exposed to elevated temperatures during operation , material stability is very important , but as yet little is known about it in relation to AM . 
Here , we studied changes of the AlSi10Mg alloy produced by selective laser melting ( SLM ) after its exposure to temperatures between 120 and 180 & deg ; C. At each temperature , hardness evolution was measured , with hardness increasing over time . 
The maximum hardness state obtained at 160 & deg ; C was selected for further studies comprising microstructural analysis by scanning and transmission electron microscopy , chemical composition analysis and mechanical properties assessment . 
Transmission microscopy revealed nano-scale acicular precipitates that caused a slight increase in the yield strength of the alloy together with a significant drop in elongation . 
Electron energy loss spectroscopy ( EELS ) and energy dispersive spectroscopy ( EDS ) showed that the precipitates surprisingly consisted of pure Si . 
To provide a comparison , conventional regimes of heat treatment ( stress-relief and T6 ) were applied . 
Despite a considerable loss in mechanical performance , thermal instability was no longer observed . 
Overall , our results indicate that operating temperatures are a key factor in ensuring the smooth operation of AM parts of the AlSi10Mg alloy . 
In respect to that , we offer recommendations for their industrial use.Additive manufacturing of aluminum alloys is considered a promising layer-wise manufacturing method which can produce lightweight critical automotive/aerospace/military components with enhanced ... Additive manufacturing of metals is a production process developed in the last few years to realize net shape components with complex geometry and high performance . 
AlSi10Mg is one of the most widely used aluminium alloys , both in this field and in conventional foundry processes , for its significant mechanical properties combined with good corrosion resistance . 
In this paper the effect of heat treatment on AlSi10Mg alloy was investigated . 
Solution and ageing treatments were carried out with different temperatures and times on samples obtained by direct metal laser sintering and gravity casting in order to compare their performance . 
Microstructural analyses and hardness tests were performed to investigate the effectiveness of the heat treatment . 
The results were correlated to the sample microstructure and porosity , analysed by means of optical microscopy and density measurements . 
It was found that , in the additive manufactured samples , the heat treatment can reduce significantly the performance of the alloy also because of the increase of porosity due to entrapped gas during the deposition technique and that the higher the solution temperature the higher the increase of such defects . 
A so remarkable effect was not found in the conventional cast alloy.AlSi10Mg is the Al alloy most applied for selective laser melting ( SLM ) processing studies . 
The characteristics and the density obtained for SLM-processed material is extremely influenced by the ... This paper aims to study the manufacturing of the AlSi10Mg alloy with direct energy deposition ( DED ) process . 
Following fabrication , the macro- and microstructural evolution of the as-processed specimens was initially investigated using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy . 
Columnar dendritic structure was the dominant solidification feature of the deposit ; nevertheless , detailed microstructural analysis revealed cellular morphology near the substrate and equiaxed dendrites at the top end of the deposit . 
Moreover , the microstructural morphology in the melt pool boundary of the deposit differed from the one in the core of the layers . 
The remaining porosity of the deposit was evaluated by Archimedes ' principle and by image analysis of the polished surface . 
Crystallographic texture in the deposit was also assessed using electron backscatter diffraction and x-ray diffraction analysis . 
The dendrites were unidirectionally oriented at an angle of 80° to the substrate . 
EPMA line scans were performed to evaluate the compositional variation and elemental segregation in different locations . 
Eventually , microhardness ( HV ) tests were conducted in order to study the hardness gradient in the as-DED-processed specimen along the deposition direction . 
The presented results , which exhibited a deposit with an almost defect free structure , indicate that the DED process can suitable for the deposition of Al-Si-based alloys with a highly consolidated structure.Abstract The AlSi10Mg alloy samples with the size of 14×14×91mm were produced by the selective laser melting ( SLM ) method in different building direction . 
The structures and the properties at -70°C of the sample in different direction were investigated . 
The results show that the structure in different building direction shows different morphology . 
The fish scale structures distribute on the side along the building direction , and the oval structures distribute on the side vertical to the building direction . 
Some pores in with the maximum size of 100 μm exist of the structure . 
And there is no major influence for the build orientation on the tensile properties . 
The tensile strength and the elongation of the sample in the building direction are 340 Mpa and 11.2 % respectively . 
And the tensile strength and the elongation of the sample vertical to building direction are 350 Mpa and 13.4 % respectivelyPeriodic honeycombs have been used for their high strength , low weight and multifunctionality . 
The quasi-static and dynamic compressive responses of three types of additively manufactured AlSi10Mg honeycomb structures , specifically a single-scale honeycomb and two hierarchical honeycombs with two and three levels of hierarchy , respectively , have been investigated using experimental measurement and finite element ( FE ) simulations . 
The validated FE simulation has been employed to investigate the effects of relative density of the honeycombs and the key experimental parameters . 
The following failure modes of the three types of honeycombs have been observed both under quasi-static and dynamic compression : ( 1 ) the single-scale honeycomb experienced a transition of failure mechanism from local plastic buckling of walls to local damage of the parent material without buckling with the increase of the relative density of the honeycomb ; ( 2 ) the hierarchical honeycombs all failed with parent material damage without buckling at different relative densities . 
For both quasi-static and dynamic compression , the hierarchical honeycombs offer higher peak nominal wall stresses compared to the single-scale honeycomb at low relative density of ρ ¯ = 0.19 mathContainer Loading Mathjax ; the difference is diminished as relative density increases , i.e . 
the three types of honeycombs can achieve similar peak wall stresses when ρ ¯ ⩾ 0.26 . 
mathContainer Loading Mathjax Numerical results have suggested the hierarchical honeycombs can offer better energy absorption capacity than the single-scale honeycomb . 
The two-scale and three-scale hierarchical honeycombs achieved similar peak nominal wall stresses for both quasi-static and dynamic compression , which may suggest that the structural performance under out-of-plane compression is not sensitive to the hierarchical architecture . 
This work indicates that the structural advantage of hierarchical honeycombs can be utilised to develop high performance lightweight structural components.•An AlSi10Mg alloy fabricated by selective laser melting was uniaxial tensile loaded.•In situ neutron diffraction was applied to separate lattice strains from each constituent.•Significant stress partitioning exists between the Si ( 680 MPa ) and Al ( 260 MPa ) constituents.•Fracture surface elucidates large voids and crack propagation along the soft Al matrix.An in-situ nano-TiB2 decorated AlSi10Mg composite ( NTD-Al ) powder was fabricated by gas-atomisation for selective laser melting ( SLM ) . 
Fully dense and crack-free NTD-Al samples were produced using SLM . 
In contrast to the NTD-Al powder without cell-like microstructure , the SLMed NTD-Al had a textureless microstructure , consisting of fine grains and cells , with well dispersed nano-TiB2 particles inside the grains and rod-like nano-Si precipitates inside the cells . 
Both nano-TiB2 particles and nano-Si precipitates exhibited a highly coherent interface with the Al matrix , indicative of a strong interfacial bonding . 
The formation of this microstructure was attributed to the sequential solidification of non-equilibrium and eutectic Al-Si upon rapid cooling during SLM . 
As a result , the SLMed NTD-Al showed a very high ultimate tensile strength ∼530 MPa , excellent ductility ∼15.5 % and high microhardness ∼191 HV0.3 , which were higher than most conventionally fabricated wrought and tempered Al alloys , previously SLMed Al-Si alloys and nano-grained 7075 Al . 
The underlying mechanisms for this strength and ductility enhancement were discussed and a correlation between this novel microstructure and the superior mechanical properties was established . 
This study provides new and deep insights into the fabrication of metal matrix nanocomposites by SLM from in-situ pre-decorated composite powder.It is shown that the defect size is the first order parameter in terms of the fatigue resistance . 
Through the Kitagawa diagrams for as-built and heat treated samples , we quantify the improvement of the fatigue resistance due to the peak hardening treatment.The present paper systematically investigated the influence of solution and artificial aging heat treatments on the microstructures and mechanical properties of SLM-produced AlSi10Mg alloy parts . 
Due to the high cooling rate of SLM , an ultrafine eutectic microstructure in the as-built samples is characterized by spherical nano-sized network eutectic Si embedded in the Al matrix , which gives rise to significantly better tensile properties and Vickers micro-hardness . 
The solubility of Si atom in the Al matrix of as-built SLM samples is calculated to be 8.89at % . 
With the increase in the solution temperature , the solubility decreases rapidly . 
The artificial aging causes the further decrease of the solubility of Si atoms in the Al matrix . 
Upon solution heat treatment , Si atoms are rejected from the supersaturated Al matrix to form small Si particles . 
With increasing the solution temperature , the size of the Si particles increases , whereas their number decreases . 
After artificial aging , the Si particles are further coarsened . 
The variation in size of Si particles has a significant influence on the mechanical properties of the AlSi10Mg samples . 
The tensile strength decreases from 434.25±10.7MPa for the as-built samples to 168.11±2.4MPa , while the fracture strain remarkably increases from 5.3±0.22 % to 23.7±0.84 % when the as-built sample is solution-treated at 550°C for 2h . 
This study indicates that the microstructure and mechanical properties of SLM-processed AlSi10Mg alloy can be tailored by suitable solution and artificial aging heat treatments.Additive manufacturing processes are becoming attractive technologies for producing complex components in relatively a short time and at reasonable cost . 
The present study aims to evaluate the effect ... AZ31B Magnesium ( Mg ) alloys and Ti-6Al-4V titanium ( Ti ) alloys were joined by laser welding-brazing process with AZ91Mg based filler . 
Uniform and continuous weld surfaces without obvious defects were produced in a relatively large processing window . 
In the process Al element diffused from the filler and reacted with Ti resulting in metallurgical bonding of Mg/Ti joint . 
The aim of this review is to analyze and to summarize the state of the art of the processing of aluminum alloys , and in particular of the AlSi10Mg alloy , obtained by means of the Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) technique known as Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) . 
This process is gaining interest worldwide , thanks to the possibility of obtaining a freeform fabrication coupled with high mechanical properties related to a very fine microstructure . 
However , SLM is very complex , from a physical point of view , due to the interaction between a concentrated laser source and metallic powders , and to the extremely rapid melting and the subsequent fast solidification . 
The effects of the main process variables on the properties of the final parts are analyzed in this review : from the starting powder properties , such as shape and powder size distribution , to the main process parameters , such as laser power and speed , layer thickness , and scanning strategy . 
Furthermore , a detailed overview on the microstructure of the AlSi10Mg material , with the related tensile and fatigue properties of the final SLM parts , in some cases after different heat treatments , is presented.The selective laser melting ( SLM ) of aluminium alloys is of interest to researchers because of these alloys ’ potential applications in the aerospace and automotive domains . 
Post-processing is ... Due to the promising properties of high entropy alloy , TiVCrAlSi high entropy alloy coating was prepared on Ti-6Al-4V alloy surface by laser cladding . 
The microstructure and phase analysis of as-cast TiVCrAlSi alloy and laser clad coating were characterized by scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction . 
The results indicate that as-cast TiVCrAlSi alloy is mainly composed of ( Ti , V ) ( 5 ) Si ( 3 ) and bcc phase . 
The laser clad coating is metallurgically bonded to the substrate with few pores and cracks . 
Laser clad TiVCrAlSi coating is also composed of ( Ti , V ) ( 5 ) Si ( 3 ) and bcc phases.Approximately equimolar ratio TiVCrAlSi high entropy alloy coatings has been deposited by laser cladding on Ti-6Al-4V alloy . 
The analysis of the microstructure by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) shows that the coating is metallurgically bonded to the substrate . 
X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) and energy dispersive spectrometer ( EDS ) analyses show that TiVCrAlSi coating is composed of precipitates of ( Ti , V ) 5Si 3 dispersed in a body-centered cubic ( BCC ) matrix . 
Intermetallic compound ( Ti , V ) 5Si 3 forms because the formation is accompanied by larger variation on enthalpy , which may offset the entropy term . 
The dry sliding wear tests show that the wear resistance of Ti-6Al-4V is improved by laser cladding with TiVCrAlSi . 
The enhancement of the wear resistance is explained by the presence of the hard silicide phase dispersed in a relatively ductile BCC matrix , which allows sliding wear to occur in the mild oxidative regime for a wide range of testing conditions . 
The microstructure and mechanical properties of high silicon Al9Si0.45Mg alloys without grain refinement and refined by Al5Ti1B and Al3Ti3B master alloys were investigated . 
The results showed that the primary α–Al grain sizes were 1288±361 μm and 645±146 μm in the non–refined and Al5Ti1B refined alloys respectively , and that was decreased significantly to 326±116 μm in Al3Ti3B refined alloy . 
After T6 heat treatment , the yield strength , ultimate tensile strength and elongation of the non–refined alloy were 298±2 MPa , 350±2 MPa and 4.5±0.7 % separately . 
When the grain refiner was changed from Al5Ti1B to Al3Ti3B , the yield strength was increased from 304±2 MPa to 311±1 MPa , the ultimate tensile strength was increased from 357±3 MPa to 366±1 MPa , and the elongation was increased significantly by 38.8 % from 8.0±1.0 % to 11.1±1.2 % . 
The Hall–Petch relation between the yield strength and grain size of the heat–treated alloys was determined as σ y = 285.1 + 470.2· d −1/2 . 
It was found that β '' phase was precipitated from the α–Al matrix for the peak strengthening of the heat–treated alloys . 
TiB 2 and TiAl 3 particles were found coexisting in Al5Ti1B master alloy , while TiB 2 and AlB 2 particles were verified coexisting in Al3Ti3B master alloy . 
The inoculation of AlB 2 particles results in the significant grain refinement under Al3Ti3B . 
The increase of strength in the Al3Ti3B refined alloy is attributed to the refinement of the primary α–Al grains , while the increase of ductility in the Al3Ti3B refined alloy resulted from the reduced oxides and porosity defects as well as decreased grain size.Der Effekt der Veredelung lÃ¤Ãt sich auch durch die MÃ¶glichkeit einer Keimbildung und des Wachstums der neuen AlSb-Phase vor der Kristallisationsfornt beeinflussen . 
Direct metal laser sintering ( DMLS ) is an additive manufacturing technique for the production of parts with complex geometry and it is especially appropriate for structural applications in aircraft ... Abstract The presented work describes the results of examination of the mechanical properties of castings made either of AlSi9Mg alloy matrix composite reinforced with short carbon fibre or of the pure AlSi9Mg alloy . 
The tensile strength , the yield strength , Young ’ s modulus , and the unit elongation were examined both for initial castings and for castings made of the remelted composite or AlSi9Mg alloy . 
After preparing metallographic specimens , the structure of the remelted materials was assessed . 
A few non-metallic inclusions were observed in the structure of the remelted composite , not occurring in the initial castings . 
Mechanical testing revealed that all the examined properties of the initial composite material exceed those of the non-reinforced matrix . 
A decrease in mechanical properties was stated both for the metal matrix and for the composite after the remelting process , but this decrease was so slight that it either does not preclude them from further use or does not restrict the range of their application.The electromagnetic stirring combined with mechanical stirring ( EMSCMV ) method was developed for preparing the AlSi9Mg alloy semi-solid slurry ; The experimental results demonstrate that , the preparation of semi-solid slurry by EMSCMV is sufficient to obtain fine microstructure of billet . 
The primary alpha-Al particles are small , spherical and uniform throughout the microstructure . 
When increasing the stirring power and the vibrating power , the size of primary alpha-Al particles decreases while the shape factor increases , and its distribution is more uniform . 
The fine microstructure of billet prepared by EMSCMV was obtained at the stirring power of 2.0 similar to 2.4 kW and vibrating power of 0.8 kW.•Amorphous CoFeAlSi alloy films are fabricated by sputtering at room temperature.•Magnetic anisotropy consists of uniaxial and cubic structural anisotropy sharing parallel easy axes.•Oxidation arising from high temperature annealing leads to the reduction in saturation magnetization.•The interplay between thermal dependent magnetization and crystallization behavior is demonstrated.•The activation barrier is optically determined to be 1.32eV.The research results of correlation between technological parameters and grain size for AlSi1Mg aluminum alloy are presented in this paper . 
The investigation were carried out under industrial conditions on a hammer and a press at temperature of 350 to 500degC . 
Strain , strain rate and temperature were assumed as important technological parameters influencing the grain size . 
The research revealed strong correlation between strain and grain size . 
Grain growth is observed for strains of from 0.05 to 0.30 . 
Optimal technological parameters were also determined . 
The results of the above-mentioned researches were used to forecast the structure of forging of AlSi1Mg alloy . 
For this reason , simulations of the forging process using finite element method were carried out . 
An outstanding approach for the tailoring of material properties is the grain refinement by the application of very high strains with changing strain path . 
Methods of severe plastic deformation ( SPD ) can create ultrafine-grained or nanostructured metallic materials with new combinations of physical and mechanical properties . 
Classical severe plastic deformation methods focus typically on the uniform modification of the microstructure throughout the complete volume .

The resulting mechanical properties in different regions of a graded material are analyzed by hardness measurements and tensile tests . 
The mechanical properties of the graded billets show the typical characteristics of coarse grained material in the core region and that of severely deformed material in the kneaded region at the surface of the billets.Kornfeinung durch das Einbringen groÃer plastischer Dehnungen mit wechselnden Verformungsrichtungen ist eine herausragende MÃ¶glichkeit der Gestaltung von Werkstoffeigenschaften .

The parts produced using SLM may be subjected to severe dynamic loading conditions during service . 
Very little ... Selective laser melting is a maturing additive manufacturing process which has been studied in the recent years for processing different alloys . 
The focus , however , remained on the processibility , design considerations and static or quasistatic mechanical properties . 
For the application of the process for functional components , it is required that the process parts perform well in cyclic applications as well . 
The influence of processing parameters on the resulting part parameters and the corresponding fatigue behavior remains unaddressed . 
This study investigates the influence of base plate heating and post-process stress-relief on part properties like process-incited defects , which are critical for fatigue loading , for AlSi12 alloy . 
Investigations have been made for very high cycle fatigue as well as fatigue crack growth . 
To understand the fatigue phenomenon , characterization of basic material properties is also carried out . 
Results show that the material defects as well as microstructure is influenced by these parameters . 
The corresponding fatigue and crack growth behavior is improved by base plate heating which changes the fatigue crack initiation mechanisms as well . 
Relatively reduced thermal gradient by base plate heating helps to improve the fatigue reliability by reducing the fatigue crack initiation from material defects.The three-dimensional ( 3D ) microstructure of an AlSi12Ni alloy in as-cast and in solution-treated conditions is characterized by light optical and synchrotron tomography . 
Eutectic Al-Si alloys containing 1 wt. % Ni in as-cast condition present networks of connected Si lamellae as well as complex 3D shapes of Ni-containing aluminides . 
The eutectic Si networks disintegrate during solution treatment in the binary Al-Si alloy while they remain connected in the Al-Si-Ni alloy . 
The contiguity between eutectic Si and Ni-containing aluminides is maintained , when the alloy is solution treated at 540degC for 24 h. The sphericity of the aluminides is only slightly increased by the solution treatment . 
The reinforcing role of eutectic Si together with the Ni-containing aluminides is governed by a stable interconnectivity and contiguity of these rigid phases accumulating ~20 vol. % . 
The 3D data obtained by synchrotron tomography quantify connectivity , shape and volume fraction of eutectic Si and aluminides , whereas their contiguity is verified by light optical sectioning tomography . 
The strength at room temperature and at 300 & # xa0 ; & # xb0 ; C as well as the thermal cycling creep resistance are studied for an AlSi12Ni alloy and compared with Ni-free AlSi12 and AlSi1.1 alloys in as cast condition and after different spheroidization treatments . 
The architecture of the AlSi12Ni cast alloy consists of a ductile & # x3b1 ; -Al matrix and a rigid , long-range three-dimensional structure of eutectic Si and primary aluminides . 
In the as cast condition , the AlSi12Ni alloy shows 50 % higher strength at 300 & # xa0 ; & # xb0 ; C and 30 % longer thermal cycling life as compared to the AlSi12 alloy . 
The strength and the thermal cycling creep resistance decrease for both the AlSi12 and AlSi12Ni alloys with increasing periods of the spheroidization treatment at 540 & # xa0 ; & # xb0 ; C and stabilize at 24 & # xa0 ; h. The higher strength at 300 & # xa0 ; & # xb0 ; C and the lower minimum strain rate in thermal cycling creep exhibited by the AlSi12Ni alloy with respect to the Ni-free alloys is conserved independently of the spheroidization treatment time . 
The improved thermomechanical properties exhibited by the AlSi12Ni alloy are due to the load carrying capacity of the hybrid three-dimensional structure . 
This is promoted by the preservation of the contiguity between the aluminides and the eutectic Si during ST as well as by the characteristics of the rigid phases such as mechanical properties , volume fraction , morphology and distribution.The microstructure and mechanical properties of AlSi9Cu alloy ribbons produced by melt spinning were investigated by field emission gun scanning electron microscope ( FEGSEM ) , X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , tensile and microhardness tests . 
The solidification time and cooling rate of the 54 p , m thick ribbon were estimated to be 9 x 10 ( -5 ) s and 5.72 x 10 ( 6 ) K s ( -1 ) respectively . 
XRD results revealed supersaturated solid-solubility of Si in Al matrix to be 3.03 and 3.57 at. % for the wheel side and free surface of the ribbon separately . 
Microstructure evolution of three gradient regions along the cross-section of the ribbon was studied by SEM in detail , and fine spherical Si particles ranged from 12 to 290 nm were found to be distributed both in the Al matrix and the alpha-Al boundary . 
The ultimate tensile strength of the ribbon was as high as 383 MPa and 1.8 times higher than that of the conventional cast ingot , and the breaking elongation of the ribbon was about 1.5 % with cleavage fracture feature , while the microhardness of the ribbon was 2.5 times higher than that of the ingot . 
( C ) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.The main objective of this study is to examine the influence of trace additions of silver on the morphology and composition of the complex microstructure of the intermetallic phases in AlSi12 alloy . 
Intermetallics were found in short or long rod , or 'Chinese Script ' , forms containing Si , Fe , Mn , Ag and Mg , These compounds became richer towards the grain boundaries . 
It was observed that the high Ag content intermetallics were created in the form of short rods . 
In all samples with added Ag , the dendritic structures had transformed into non-dendritic ones . 
The addition of Ag , in addition to the degeneration of the dendritic structures , enhanced the transformation from rosette form to globular morphologies . 
The results showed that the amount of eutectic Si increased with small additions of Ag to the AlSi12 alloy . 
It was established that in general the Ag is distributed within the eutectic structure.The paper deals with the impact of technological parameters on the mechanical properties and microstructure in AlSi12 alloy using squeeze casting technology . 
The casting with crystallization under pressure was used , specifically direct squeeze casting method . 
The goal was to affect crystallization by pressure with a value 100 and 150 MPa . 
From the experiments we can conclude that operating pressure of 100 MPa is sufficient to influence the structural characteristics of the alloy AlSi12 . 
The change in cooling rate influences the morphology of the silicon particles and intermetallic phases . 
A change of excluded needles to a rod-shaped geometries with significantly shorter length occurs when used gravity casting method . 
At a pressure of 100 MPa was increased of tensile strength on average of 20 % . 
At a pressure of 150 MPa was increased of tensile strength on average of 30 % . 
During the experiment it was also observed , that increasing difference between the casting temperature and the mold temperature leads to increase of mechanical properties . 
The relationship between friction stir processing ( FSP ) parameters and longitudinal residual stress profiles in modified cast aluminium alloy AlSi9Mg is presented . 
The influence of tool geometry , rotational speed and the number of processing passes were analysed . 
To experimentally measure residual stress , the trepanation method was adopted . 
The results indicated that an increase in the rotational speed caused an increase in the residual stress . 
Also , the Triflute tool promoted a higher level of residual stress than a conventional FSP tool . 
The region around the FSP bead was characterised by tensile residual stress fields that were balanced by compressive stresses in the parent material . 
A higher residual stress is observed on the advancing side than on the retreating side . 
An increase in the number of processing passes increased the level of residual stress in the modified material.Aluminium alloys possess excellent mechanical , physically chemical and technological properties which have found an extensive application in the automotive industry . 
Alloy AlSi11 belongs to a group ... A newly transient mesoscopic model with a randomly packed powder-bed has been proposed to investigate the heat and mass transfer and laser process quality between neighboring tracks during selective laser melting ( SLM ) AlSi12 alloy by finite volume method ( FVM ) , considering the solid/liquid phase transition , variable temperature-dependent properties and interfacial force . 
The results apparently revealed that both the operating temperature and resultant cooling rate were obviously elevated by increasing the laser power . 
Accordingly , the resultant viscosity of liquid significantly reduced under a large laser power and was characterized with a large velocity , which was prone to result in a more intensive convection within pool . 
In this case , the sufficient heat and mass transfer occurred at the interface between the previously fabricated tracks and currently building track , revealing a strongly sufficient spreading between the neighboring tracks and a resultant high-quality surface without obvious porosity . 
By contrast , the surface quality of SLM-processed components with a relatively low laser power notably weakened due to the limited and insufficient heat and mass transfer at the interface of neighboring tracks . 
Furthermore , the experimental surface morphologies of the top surface were correspondingly acquired and were in full accordance to the calculated results via simulation.The purpose of this work was to elaborate the method of manufacturing of composite materials based on porous mullite preforms infiltrated by AlSi12 aluminium alloy . 
The process of manufacturing the metal matrix composites by pressure infiltration is the subject of many scientific studies because it is characterized by high efficiency and allows for accurate mapping of elements of shape and surface of elements , while the structure and properties of the composites are determined by ceramic skeletons . 
The eutectic aluminium alloy AlSi12 was used as a matrix while as a reinforcement were used ceramic preforms fabricated by sintering of halloysite nanotubes ( HNT ) powder with an addition of carbon fibres as pore forming agents . 
The observations of the structure were made on the light microscope and in the scanning electron microscope . 
The developed technology of manufacturing of composite materials with the pore ceramic mullite infiltration ensures the expected structure and can be used in practice . 
The composite materials made by the developed method can find application as an alternative material for elements fabricated from light metal matrix composite material reinforced with ceramic fibrous preforms.Ultrasound treatment of liquid aluminum alloys is known to improve mechanical properties of castings . 
Aluminum foundry alloys are frequently used for production of parts that undergo severe cavitation erosion phenomena during service . 
In this paper , the effect of the ultrasound treatment on cavitation erosion resistance of AlSi7 alloy was assessed and compared to that of conventionally cast samples . 
Cavitation erosion tests were performed according to ASTM G32 standard on as-cast and heat treated castings . 
The response of the alloy in each condition was investigated by measuring the mass loss as a function of cavitation time and by analyzing the damaged surfaces by means of optical and scanning electron microscope . 
It was pointed out that the ultrasound treatment increases the cavitation erosion resistance of the alloy , as a consequence of the higher chemical and microstructural homogeneity , the finer grains and primary particles and the refined structure of the eutectic induced by the treatment itself.Swage casting , a new semisolid metal processing technology , has been developed in Balkan Center for Advanced Casting Technologies ( BCACT ) for manufacturing near-net shape components from leightweight metals . 
Components with one rotating axis such as a cylinder can be produced on a swage casting machine from molten metal in a one-step operation . 
The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of intensive shearing action on the morphological evolution of as swage-cast A356 ( AlSi7Mg0.3 ) alloy . 
Compared with conventional squeeze casting , the experimental results show that intensive melt stirring during swage casting , promotes the formation of net-globular and rosette-shaped grains.The semi-solid slurry of AlSi7 alloy was prepared by near-liquids cast processing . 
The effects of different content of RE on the cast performance and the semi-solid remelting performance in AlSi7 alloy was researched . 
The results indicated that adding RE will widen the AlSi7 alloy solid-liquid two-phase zone temperature and refine the grains , silicon will obvious metamorphoses . 
The best amount of RE is about 0.5 % . 
Its semi-solid remelting organization is equilateral globular grains.Experimental work has been undertaken to study the effects of polystyrene pattern material on the mechanical properties and microstructures of cast aluminium alloys . 
This paper reports results obtained using AlâSi 7 % ( LM25 ) alloy . 
Rectangular tensile test-pieces of various thickness were cast at different pouring temperatures into standard resin-bonded sand moulds . 
The experiments were then repeated with polystyrene patterns placed into the sand mould cavities . 
A direct comparison of the effects of polystyrene pattern material on the properties of the cast test-pieces with those obtained under identical conditions by a standard sand casting method has thus been obtained . 
Ultimate tensile strength , elongation , Vickers hardness , porosity volume , and dendrite arm spacing ( DAS ) values relating to both methods were evaluated for a range of casting section thickness ( 4â16 mm ) and pouring temperature ( 690â780 Â°C ) . 
The microstructural differences observed between the test pieces obtained , with and without polystyrene patterns , were verified by the changes in the solidification cooling curves recorded simultaneously for both methods.The anisotropy in the tensile properties of AlSi12 alloy fabricated using selective laser melting ( SLM ) additive manufacturing process was investigated . 
The tensile samples were printed in three different orientations , horizontal ( H - 0° ) , inclined ( I - 45° ) , and vertical ( V - 90° ) , and found to exhibit yield strength between 225 MPa and 263 MPa , tensile strength between 260 MPa and 365 MPa , and ductility between 1 and 4 % , showing distinct fracture patterns . 
It was established that the build orientation had insignificant effect on the microstructural characteristics of the SLM-printed samples , while XRD phase analysis showed variations in the Al ( 111 ) and Al ( 200 ) peak intensities . 
Consequently , the anisotropy in the mechanical properties of the SLM-printed AlSi12 samples was attributed to the differences in their relative density . 
Although the energy density was kept constant when printing the samples along different orientations , the “ energy per layer ” was found to be different owing to the variation in the printing area along the build direction . 
Further investigation on the effect of printing area , and correspondingly energy per layer , on the relative density was carried out . 
It was found that energy per layer in the range of 504 – 895 J yielded ≥ 99.8 % relatively dense AlSi12 SLM-printed samples . 
This study puts forth a new idea that the density of the SLM-printed samples could be controlled using energy per layer as an input process parameter.The actual foam density affects its mechanical energy absorption capabilities . 
Making structural elements starting from the cutting of semi-finished items may produce uneven results due to the lack of homogeneity in the foam . 
The subject of this work is the study of AlSi7 metallic foams , the focus being on the evaluation of the effective density distribution throughout large ingots . 
This is the first step required to establish a correlation between manufacturing process parameters and mechanical properties . 
The results highlighted that the void density increases from the centre toward the ingot outer wall and that specimens coming from different regions of the ingot have a very different mechanical behaviour . 
This is probably due to the difficulty in controlling temperature gradients and cooling rates throughout big mould cavities during the production process .

Aluminum foundry alloys are frequently used for production of parts that undergo severe cavitation erosion phenomena during service . 
In this paper , the effect of the ultrasound treatment on cavitation erosion resistance of AlSi7 alloy was assessed and compared to that of conventionally cast samples . 
Cavitation erosion tests were performed according to ASTM G32 standard on as-cast and heat treated castings . 
The response of the alloy in each condition was investigated by measuring the mass loss as a function of cavitation time and by analyzing the damaged surfaces by means of optical and scanning electron microscope . 
It was pointed out that the ultrasound treatment increases the cavitation erosion resistance of the alloy , as a consequence of the higher chemical and microstructural homogeneity , the finer grains and primary particles and the refined structure of the eutectic induced by the treatment itself.Diesel engines , characterized by higher breakout pressure and compression ratio in comparison with gasoline engines , require particularly elevated tensile properties for their engine parts . 
In order to maintain both high strength and high ductility in the cylinder head , i.e. , to obtain higher percent elongation without further reducing the tensile strength , Al Si9Cu1 alloy was used to prepare the cylinder head in an aluminum diesel engine . 
At the same time , the effect of different modification elements , Na or Sr , and Fe content on the reduction of secondary dendrite arm spacing ( SDAS ) was discussed , and the design of T7 heat treatment parameters were analyzed in order to improve the tensile ductility . 
The result shows : ( 1 ) The SDAS is as small as 18±3 μm for the Sr modified alloy . 
( 2 ) The percent elongation of the alloy with Sr modification increases by 66.7 % and 42.9 % , respectively , compared with the unmodified alloy and the alloy with Na modification . 
( 3 ) Lower Fe content alloy ( 0.10 % ) gives good results in percent elongation compared to the alloy with higher Fe content ( 0.27 % ) ; in particular , after Sr modification and T7 heat treatment , the elongation of over 5 % is obtained.Quaternary Co 2 FeAl 0.5 Si 0.5 Heusler alloy thin films have attracted special attention for the application in magnetoelectronic devices . 
Co 2 FeAl 0.5 Si 0.5 alloy thin films are fabricated by magnetron sputtering at room temperature . 
The temperature effects on the magnetic , electrical and optical properties in sputtered Co 2 FeAl 0.5 Si 0.5 alloy films are investigated . 
Thermomagnetic measurements reveal increased magnetization arising from enhanced crystalline ferromagnetic ordering . 
Anomalous increase in electrical resistivity with temperature is probed in the alloy film , accompanied with significant change in optical reflectance . 
The large variations in electrical and optical signals in the alloy film can be attributed to the transition of atomic orderings , confirmed by X-ray diffraction measurements . 
The activation barrier for the transformation of atomic orderings is determined to be 1.22 eV , showing good thermal stability of the Heusler alloy thin film.In the present investigation , AlSi17 Aluminum alloy closed-cell foam is fabricated through Melt route process using Calcium powder as thickening agent and Titanium hydride as foaming agent along with the addition of 10wt % Silicon Carbide particles . 
The effect of pore and pore size on the deformation mechanism under static loading conditions is studied . 
Also , the fabricated foam properties are analyzed after the completion of the test . 
The strain rate loading conditions of the compression test conducted on the Al foam lies in the range of 10 -3 s -1 to 10s -1 and the above investigations are carried out according to the loading conditions . 
The Artificial Neural Artwork ( ANN ) approach is employed for predicting the compressive deformation of the fabricated Al alloy foam using simulations . 
The Plateau stress data is obtained from the compression tests and the neural network functions are successively modeled and later the specific energy absorption ( SEA ) is calculated from the plateau stress . 
The simulation results of the ANN are in good agreement with the compression test results and the predictions are performed with highest accuracy.Thermal analysis has been used for decades for melt control before casting aluminum alloys . 
However , obtaining a good grain refinement in a standard cup does not ensure that the grain refinement is correct in real parts which may solidify at very different cooling rates . 
For this study , the effect of cooling rate on AlSi7Mg alloy with different metal qualities in terms of grain refinement was tested . 
The correlation between grain sizes measured on the standard cup with those obtained in cylindrical test parts with various diameters cast in sand and metallic moulds has been investigated . 
It was found possible to set up a formula for the grain size of the cylindrical test parts in function of their modulus and of the grain refinement obtained on the standard thermal cups . 
Corrective actions can then be taken in order to improve the metallurgical quality before casting.Molten aluminium alloy is so active that it an easily chemically react with O2 and H2O to form Al2O3 inclusions and H during melting practice . 
However , some other inclusions form by process . 
Under turbulent flow conditions , the inclusions are distributed unevenly in molten aluminium alloy . 
They may associate with crack or by the location of crack initiation in solidified casting . 
Castings containing these inclusions will probably exhibit poor ductility or toughness . 
Therefore , the purification of the molten aluminium alloy is one of the most important processes for improving the quality of Al-products . 
The inclusions in molten secondary AlSi7Mg0.3 cast alloy ( without refining or modification ; grain refined with 55 ppm AlTi5B1 and modified with 20 , 40 and 60 ppm AlSr10 ) were removed using depth filtration by ceramic foam and pressed filter . 
The results showed that the mechanical properties through filtration changes . 
Ductility and UTS of the filtered tensile specimens increases . 
The better mechanical properties were measured by the using of pressed ceramic filter . 
Highest UTS and ductility was observed for samples modified with 40 ppm of Sr. Filtration with ceramic filters have very significant influence on the porosity decreasing ; in the process the better effect has a pressed filter . 
In samples modified with 60 ppm of Sr were observed effect of over modification ( mechanical properties decreased ; porosity increased ) .This study focuses on modelling the fatigue life reduction of an AlSi9Cu3 aluminium alloy caused by macro-porosity . 
The objective was to develop an engineering approach to fatigue life prediction for structural elements with macro-porosity defects . 
By following this approach a finite element analysis is first applied to assess the dependence of the strain-concentration factor , caused by a failure-dominant pore , on the nominal strain , the pore size and the proximity to the specimen surface . 
This dependence is then modelled by a nonlinear equation with three independent variables , i.e . 
the nominal strain , the pore size and the pore proximity to the specimen surface . 
The parameters of this equation are determined according to the results of the finite element analysis using a real-valued genetic algorithm . 
The proposed numerical approach was validated using experimental results . 
For this purpose , cylindrical specimens were manufactured by a high-pressure die casting and three levels of porosity were deliberately introduced into the specimens . 
The specimens were then tested at several strain levels and the corresponding fatigue life curves were estimated . 
The statistical significance of the fatigue life reduction due to the porosity level was statistically analysed and the experimental results were compared to the fatigue lives that were calculated with the presented strain-concentration model . 
The comparison showed a good agreement between the calculated and the experimentally obtained fatigue lives.Electro-pulse modification ( EPM ) was used to change the dendritic structure of AlSi 7Mg alloy to globular one . 
The effects of the modified temperature , electro-pulse frequency and time on the solidified structure were examined . 
The results show that these parameters play an important role in the solidified microstructures . 
That is to say , under the same modified temperature , the solidified microstructure will be improved greatly with the increase of electro-pulse frequency and time , but when they exceed to limit values , the solidified microstructure will become worse , resulting from the decrease of the ratio of nucleation . 
The experimental results indicate that the suitable modified temperature of AlSi 7Mg alloy is 720 °C , and the appropriate electro-pulse frequency and time are 5 Hz and 40 s , respectively . 
Then the microstructures produced by suitable EPM process were reheated at temperatures between liquidus and solidus , the primary-Al grains ripen further and become more spherical , which is favorable to the semi-solid forming of AlSi 7Mg alloy. < h3 > ABSTRACT < /h3 > < p > The influence of mechanical strength for aluminium castings is often correlated in the literature to the occurrence of cast defects like porosity . 
However , because aluminium castings in the automotive industry are often used without surface treatment such as painting etc. , the influence of corrosion and its effect on fatigue properties are required . 
Basically a surrounding environment can affect fatigue strength either by enhancing initiation or by increasing fatigue crack propagation properties . 
In this study , the influence of pre‐exposure prior to fatigue testing has been evaluated . 
This implies that environmental enhancement of fatigue initiation due to corrosion has been studied. < /p > < p > Two different environments [ seawater acidified test ( SWAAT ) and Volvo Indoor Corrosion Test ( VICT ) ] often employed for assessment of corrosive properties in the automotive industry have been used for pre‐exposure of specimens . 
Based on experimental results , it is shown that fatigue strength is reduced by approximately 50 % for specimens pre‐exposed to SWAAT environment , while insignificant influence was found for specimens pre‐exposed to VICT environment . 
The degradation of fatigue strength was found to be due to localized corrosive attacks . 
Propagation of these corrosive attacks takes place preferably in the eutectic phase and especially at the borderline between primary aluminium dendrites and the eutectic phase. < /p > According to the demand on conductivity of AlSi7Mg alloy from high-voltage electrical apparatus , study on improvement of AlSi7Mg alloy conductivity was carried out in this paper . 
The effects of alloying elements RE , B and aging temperature on cast AlSi7Mg alloy conductivity and mechanical property were studied . 
The result shows that the addition of 1 % RE can increase the conductivity and tensile strength well ; On the basis of 1 % RE addition , B addition can increase conductivity further , however it causes decrease of tensile strength . 
Increasing aging temperature improves conductivity visibly and make the tensile strength decrease ; It can finally conclude that with the content of RE , B 1 % and 0.07 % respectively , the conductivity of AlSi7Mg alloy could be 28S/M , meantime with the tensile strength of 244.1MPa after 520℃ 5 4h 180℃ 6h heat treatment.The effect of different pouring heights and evenly soaking process in the liquidus and solidus range on the solidified microstructure of AlSi7Mg alloy has been studied . 
The results show that if the pouring temperature is 630 or 650°C and the pouring height is 40 mm , the microstructure of the solidified melt is not homogeneous and there are many rosette-like primary α-Al grains . 
But if the pouring height is increased to 400 mm , the solidified microstructure becomes more homogeneous and favorable to obtain spherical primary α-Al grains in the solidified melt . 
With further being evenly soaked in the liquidus and solidus range for some time , the temperature difference between the melt center and the melt periphery can be controlled within ±2°C and the primary α-Al grains will evolve into more spherical grains . 
The theoretical analysis indicates that the higher pouring height promotes the melt flow motion and makes the temperature field in the melt more homogeneous and restrains the large rosette primary α-Al grains . 
This flow motion can also promote the ripening effect and the primary α-Al grains in the melt are gradually changed into spherical grains . 
It can be concluded from the experiments that pouring at an appropriate superheat and from a proper height is a good new method for preparing the semisolid slurry of AlSi7Mg alloy , its process control is easy and the preparation cost is lower.The non-dendritic primary phase is required for the production of parts through the semi-solid metal forming process , for which the spherical phase is the most favored . 
Under the condition of continuous casting with electromagnetic stirring , the primary phase tends to be rosette-like . 
For AlSi7Mg alloy , there are three possible aspects contributing to the formation of the rosette α phase . 
The billets can be reheated to their semi-solid state reliably and repeatedly through a two-phase heating procedure using a vertical tube furnace . 
The workable temperature is around 577–580 °C . 
For demonstration , the connecting rods for an air compressor were fabricated successfully through the semi-solid forming process using a 350 t high-pressure die casting unit.The semisolid slurry preparation of die steels Cr12 and Cr12MoV with high chromium content was studied . 
The results show that the semisolid slurry of both steels with solid of 40 % -60 % can be made by electromagnetic stirring method and is easy to be discharged from the bottom little hole of the stirring chamber . 
The sizes of the spherical primary austenite in the slurry of die steels Cr12 . 
Al-Si Alloys are the leading casting alloys based on aluminum . 
Inoculation of these alloys is an important part of the metallurgical process , because this operation is used to refine the structure of rough-grained to fine-grained , which usually leads to improved technological properties of the alloy . 
The article specifically examines the influence of the amount of the inoculating substance AlTi5B1 on the resulting surface roughness after machining alloy AlSi7Mg0.3In this paper , a process to make non-dendritic semi-solid AlSi 7Mg alloy by electromagnetic stirring and the temperature field of the stirred melt cooled is continuously investigated . 
It is proposed that a new kinetic factor for primary α-Al nucleation is that a low thermal gradient exists in the electromagnetically stirred melt , for which the primary dendrite arms and secondary dendrite arms are refined . 
The results also show that the root remelting of the secondary dendrite arms is an important mechanism of the primary α-Al refinement . 
Strong electromagnetic stirring greatly reduces the composition supercooling in the melt and eliminates the preferred growth of primary dendrite arms , therefore , many rosettes or spherical primary α-Al phase particles form finally . 
Within the scope of this investigation , an in situ composite of hypereutectic AlSi17 was produced by semi-continuous DC-casting in conjunction with a hot-top mould . 
The final product was billets of 196 mm dia . 
The alloy appeared to have very good castability . 
The macroscopic distribution of the primary silicon particles was inhomogeneous under standard casting conditions . 
Mechanical stirring of the liquid metal present in the hot-top , using a specially-designed mixer , provided homogeneous distribution of the primary silicon . 
The alloy was extruded at 425Â°C into rectangular strips . 
During the extrusion process , a regular pattern appeared , because the primary silicon particles clustered in rows . 
The mechanical properties parallel to the extrusion direction were : Ï0.2=80â105 MPa , ÏUTS=165â180 MPa and Îµf=8-12 % .The adhesion forces of alumina inclusions on the four filter materials were experimentally estimated with an AFM in water based model system . 
The highest adhesion forces were measured on the Al 2 O 3 substrate , followed by the 3Al 2 O 3 ·2SiO 2 , the MgAl 2 O 4 and the TiO 2 substrate . 
For inclusions > 70 μm , both the measured filtration efficiencies for > 70 μm and the adhesion forces increase by the following order of coatings : TiO 2 , 3Al 2 O 3 ·2SiO 2 , MgAl 2 O 4 , Al 2 O 3 .The standard grain refiner , Al-5Ti-1B , and Al-3B were employed to investigate the potential of B additions to grain refine the popular AlSi7Mg0.3 alloy with a focus on the impact of the latter on the mechanical properties . 
The average grain size of the AlSi7Mg0.3 alloys grain refined with the Al-5Ti-1B and Al-3B grain refiners were 465+or-102mum and 156+or-29mum , respectively , while their secondary dendrite arm spacing ( DAS ) values were very similar , 30+or-5mum , owing to identical cooling rates during solidification . 
The two groups of cast samples exhibit very similar yield , ultimate tensile strength and hardness values , in spite of a three-fold difference in the grain size evidencing that the DAS , rather than the grain size , controls the mechanical properties in aluminium castings . 
While similar in the as-cast state , the mechanical properties of the AlSi7Mg0.3 alloy grain refined with Al-3B in T6 temper are markedly superior with higher strength and elongation values . 
Since the composition and the DAS values of the two groups of samples are nearly identical , the much smaller grain structure is credited for the superior strength and hardness as well as the higher ductility in the B-treated AlSi7Mg0.3 alloy . 
[ All rights reserved Elsevier ] .The non-dendritic primary phase is required for the production of parts through semi-solid metal forming process , and the spheroidal phase is most favored . 
Under the condition of continuous casting with electromagnetic stirring , the primary phase tends to be rosette-like . 
The processing parameters such as shear rate , cooling rate , as well as billet withdrawal speed affect the solidification microstructure strongly . 
For AlSi7Mg alloy , there are three possible aspects contributing to the formation of rosette alpha phase . 
The structural evolution of sample during reheating indicates that , the eutectic melts only after the Si phase diffuses to some extent . 
The morphology of Si phase changes from flake to particulate then melts with increase in temperature . 
The rosette a phase spheroidizes through separation of petals . 
The billets can be reheated to its semi-solid state reliably and repeatedly through a two , phase heating procedure using vertical tube furnace . 
The workable temperature is around 577-580 degreesC . 
For demonstration , connecting rods for air compressor were fabricated successfully through semi-solid forming process using 350 tons high-pressure die casting unit.Different as-cast microstructures of an AlSi7Mg alloy were produced by controlling the solidification conditions . 
The as-cast grain size ranged from 1.4 mm to 160 mum and the morphology varied from dendritic to rosette-like to globular . 
The as-cast materials were then partially remelted and isothermally held at 580degC for microstructure evolution . 
The final microstructure depended on the initial as-cast microstructure and the isothermal holding time . 
After partial remelting and isothermal holding , coarse-grained dendritic structures were not able to evolve to a globular structure , while structures with medium sized dendritic grains evolved to a globular structure with a relatively large particle size after a long isothermal holding time . 
Fine-grained structures evolved to well-rounded globular grains within times ranging from 10 min to 5 min as the dendritic nature of the starting structure diminished . 
An empirical equation has been established to describe the relationship between the evolved microstructure and the as-cast microstructure . 
The combination of thermal rate treatment and low temperature pouring was proposed in the present work , and the effects of the novel melt thermal treatment on microstructure and tensile properties of AlSi7Mg alloy have been investigated . 
The grain size and microstructure of AlSi7Mg alloy were examined by optical microscopy ( OM ) and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) . 
It was found that the grain size obviously reduced and the growth of the columnar dendrites changed into equiaxed ones by low temperature pouring , especially the novel melt thermal treatment , by which a maximum microstructure refining effect could be obtained . 
The refinement can be attributed to the multiplication of the nuclei in the melt . 
Furthermore , the morphology of eutectic silicon changed little , but the size of silicon phase was finer due to the refinement of the grain size and higher cooling rate . 
Because of the refinement of the grain size and eutectic silicon , the tensile properties were improved , and the ultimate tensile strength and elongation increased by 11.7 % and 35.3 % , respectively . 
[ All rights reserved Elsevier ] .High Pressure Die Casting ( HPDC ) is a foundry process particularly suitable for high production rates and applied in several industrial fields , but the amount of scrap , caused by defects or incomplete filling , is sometimes very high . 
Thus it is important to know which are the main causes of defect formation and their effects on microstructure and mechanical properties . 
This paper presents , within the European MUSIC project , the qualitative and quantitative results of a study conducted on AlSi9Cu3 ( Fe ) alloy castings , referred to as Horse-shoe Reference Castings , specifically designed to generate different kinds of defects with different severity levels . 
The work focuses on the correlations obtained between the casting mechanical properties , their defect content in terms of porosity and oxide films and the process parameters adopted , mainly second phase plunger velocity and intensification pressure . 
The three point bending test was carried out on the four specimens obtained from the two appendixes of the casting . 
The fracture surfaces were studied by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and optical microscopy ( OM ) highlighting that the defect content is clearly correlated to the mechanical properties and the process parameter settings . 
The effects of isothermal process parameters on the microstructure evolution of semisolid AlSi7Mg alloy produced by electro-pulse modification ( EPM ) and partial remelting process were investigated using an image analysis software based on quantitative metallography . 
The results showed that long isothermal time could make the semisolid particles more globular , but the size of the particles would grow larger ; high semisolid isothermal temperature would reduce the solid volume fraction and accelerate the spherical evolution of the solid particles . 
It was found that the optimal process parameters should be 590°C and 10-20min of isothermal temperature and time respectively based on the conditions of this paper . 
The mechanism of the particles ’ formation was also discussed during the isothermal treatment.This paper deals with influence on segregation of iron based phases on the secondary alloy AlSi7Mg0.3 microstructure by nickel . 
Iron is the most common and harmful impurity in aluminum casting alloys and has long been associated with an increase of casting defects . 
In generally , iron is associated with the formation of Fe-rich intermetallic phases . 
It is impossible to remove iron from melt by standard operations . 
Some elements eliminates iron by changing iron intermetallic phase morphology , decreasing its extent and by improving alloy properties . 
Realization of experiments and results of analysis show new view on solubility of iron based phases during melt preparation with higher iron content and influence of nickel as iron corrector of iron based phases.The complex microstructure of as-cast AlSi7Mg alloy has been investigated . 
Microstructure observations were done using light microscopy , scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy . 
Chemical composition of the microstructure constituents was investigated by means of energy dispersive spectrometry , conducted both during SEM and STEM investigations . 
Selected area diffraction was used to identify the phases in the alloy . 
Microstructure of the alloy in the as-cast condition consists of Al-Si eutectic and intermetallic phases in the interdendritic regions . 
These are : Mg < sub > 2 < /sub > Si , α-AlFeMnS , β-AlFeSi and π-AlFeSiMg phases . 
What is more , number of fine precipitates were found within the α-Al dendrites . 
Only the occurrence of U1 ( MgAl < sub > 2 < /sub > Si < sub > 2 < /sub > ) phase has been confirmed . 
Effect of Fe on microstructure and mechanical properties of the primary AlSi7Mg0.3 alloy and the potential of Mn addition to counteract any adverse effects was investigated in the present work . 
The primary AlSi7Mg0.3 is a better alloy than its counterpart with twice as much Fe . 
Î² platelets grow twice as big when the Fe concentration is doubled . 
This , in turn , increases shrinkage porosity and leads to a 3-fold decrease in the tensile elongation values . 
Adding an equal amount of Mn helps to modify the Î² platelets into more compact Î± particles and also reduces shrinkage porosity . 
While these structural changes are reflected by a modest improvement in the mechanical properties , Mn addition fails to offer a full recovery in the ductility of the AlSi7Mg0.3 alloy . 
Hence , limiting the Fe content of the primary AlSi7Mg0.3 alloy to 0.12 wt % is worthwhile and pays off with superior microstructural features and mechanical properties.The examination of a fractured cavity insert , cooperated die to finish geometry intricate aluminum alloy die-casting product , is described . 
The dominating failure mechanism in the investigated insertAbstract The effect of Sr on the microstructure and mechanical properties of AlSi7Mg0.3 alloy were investigated over a wide range of Sr additions between 0.01 and 0.2 wt % . 
Sr modifies not only the eutectic Si particles but also the β-Al5FeSi needles . 
While 0.01–0.02 wt % Sr suffices to achieve an adequate level of eutectic modification , it takes higher Sr additions to modify the β-Al5FeSi needles . 
The porosity and average grain size increase with increasing Sr additions , but there is no evidence of coarsening of eutectic Si particles , to signal overmodification . 
Since the adverse and favourable effects introduced by Sr addition balance each other , the impact of Sr additions between 0.01 and 0.2 wt % on the tensile properties of AlSi7Mg0.3 alloy is limited . 
Nevertheless , tensile properties enjoy some improvement with increasing Sr additions , possibly owing to the modification of β-Al5FeSi at high Sr additions . 
The modification of β-Al5FeSi needles apparently compensates for the increasing porosity as well as grain coarsening , the two adverse effects of Sr addition.The experimental and analytical approaches were taken to investigate the non-dendritic microstructure formation and evolution of AlSi9Cu3 alloy during rheocasting . 
The results show that the globular primary a ( Al ) particles free of entrapped eutectic form after rheocasting for 3 s , and could be morphologically stabilized during subsequent growth . 
The fine and globular particles underwent a coarsening process under quiescently continuous cooling in which the particle density decreases , the solid fraction increases , the average particle size increases with the increase of solidification time at a rate that closely followed the classical Ostwald ripening.The effects of different process parameters ( temperature and time ) during the ageing treatment on the microstructure and the mechanical properties of a secondary rheocast AlSi9Cu3 ( Fe ) alloy have been examined . 
Optical microscope investigations have been performed to qualitatively study the microstructure of the as-rheocast and thermal treated alloys . 
Transmission electron microscopy technique and selected area electron diffraction analyses have been used to characterize the hardening phases precipitated in the Al-matrix during the different ageing stages . 
The evolution of mechanical properties of the Al matrix has been monitored by micro-hardness testing . 
The combined effect of high intensity ultrasound and melt stirring on the degassing of AlSi 9Cu 3 using simultaneously the novel MMM ( Multi-frequency Multimode Modulated ) ultrasonic technology to promote cavitation , and low frequency mechanical vibration to induce melt stirring , was studied . 
On a first stage single low frequency mechanical vibration experiments were carried out in water in order to visualize and characterize its individual effect on the liquid dynamics . 
On a second stage ultrasonic vibration combined with different mechanical vibration frequencies , melt temperatures and processing times were tested in liquid AlSi 9Cu 3 alloy and their influence on the degassing efficiency was evaluated and compared with the results of the single MMM ultrasonic degassing technique . 
Fixed ultrasonic parameters ( frequency and electric power ) were used , according to the best results obtained in former experimental works developed by the authors . 
For the experimental conditions used in this research , it was found that melt stirring significantly improves degassing efficiency , and such improvement depends on the metal temperature and the mechanical vibration frequency . 
The experimental results suggest that combining melt agitation and ultrasonic vibration it is possible to achieve almost the aluminum alloy theoretical density without increasing the processing time . 
[ All rights reserved Elsevier ] .In this paper we made an attempt to assess the solidification and flow behavior of the AlSi7Mg alloy melt flowing down the cooling slope , by calculating the Reynolds number of the flowing melt . 
It has been found that the length of the laminar regime within the flowing melt ( low-convection flow ) depends on the angle of slope . 
The microstructure of as-cast AlSi7Mg alloy processed by low-convection-casting using cooling slope method has been studied . 
The microstructure reveals dendritic primary alpha-Al phase with fine fibrous eutectic silicon in the interdendritic regions . 
The modification of eutectic silicon occurs predominately by the shearing of the solute-rich liquid between the primary alpha-Al dendrites prior to eutectic solidification as it flows down the cooling slope . 
Nucleation and growth of the primary silicon dendrites was also observed , which confirms earlier reports on three-layer theory . 
The mechanism responsible for the refinement of eutectic phase is the enhanced heterogeneous nucleation in the last liquid to solidify.Tensile and fatigue behaviour of an AlSi10Cu alloy cast under controlled solidification conditions . 
In this paper , the plastic instability phenomenon Portevin-Le Chatelier effect ( PLC ) was investigated in AlSi9Cu1 alloy and the in-situ ( ZrB 2 +TiB 2 ) /AlSi9Cu1 composites fabricated from the Al-K 2 TiF 6 -K 2 ZrF 6 -KBF 4 system . 
Microstructure observation and X-ray diffraction testing revealed that the ZrB 2 and TiB 2 particles were generated via direct melting reaction . 
Mechanical property testing showed that 3 wt. % ( ZrB 2 +TiB 2 ) particles reinforced composites owned the highest ultimate tensile strength ( 226 MPa ) . 
Meanwhile , the effects of mass fraction of reinforced particles , strain rate on the critical strain were also systematically studied . 
The results indicated that both normal and inverse behavior of critical strain vs. strain rate existed during the tensile deforming for AlSi9Cu1 alloy and ( ZrB 2 +TiB 2 ) /AlSi9Cu1 composites.This paper shows some results obtained by X-ray diffraction of an AlSi 7 alloy . 
The samples were cast in sand moulds , and an ultrasonic field during was used the solidification . 
The results show different behavior between classical sand cast mold alloy without and with ultrasound treatment . 
The presented analyses explain the improvement of some mechanical characteristics of the material.The present study was performed on primary AlSi10MgMn cast alloy to analyze the morphology and composition of complex microstructure of the intermetallic phases . 
AlSi10MgMn cast alloy is a typical casting alloy used for parts with thin walls and complex geometry . 
It offers good strength , hardness and dynamic properties and is therefore also used for parts subject to high loading . 
In this study , several methods were used such as : light microscopy ( LM ) and scanning ( SEM ) electron microscopy in combination with EDX analysis using standard etched or deep etched sample to identify intermetallic . 
Alloy was analyzed in as-cast state ( rapidly cooled right after casting ) and after T6 heat treatment . 
T6 treatment ( solution annealing , quenching and age hardening ) improves mechanical properties . 
The results show that the microstructure of AlSi10MgMn alloy consisted of several phases : a-matrix , eutectic , Fe-rich intermetallic phases ( Al15 ( FeMn ) 3Si2 , Al5FeSi ) , Mg2Si , Al8FeMg3Si6 and of other phases in formation . 
Iron-rich intermetallic phases are well known to be strongly influential on mechanical properties in Al-Si alloys . 
The most common morphology was the long platelets of Al5FeSi phase . 
After heat treatment were observed spheroidisation of eutectic Si , dissolution and fragmentation of Fe-phases .

Abstract An investigation was carried out in order to study the fretting fatigue behavior of an AlSi9Cu2Mg aluminum alloy . 
The fretting fatigue tests of AlSi9Cu2Mg were performed using a specially designed testing machine . 
The failure mechanism of fretting fatigue was explored by studying the fracture surfaces , fretting scars , fretting debris , and micro-hardness of fretting fatigue specimens using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ( EDX ) , and micro Vickers hardness test techniques . 
The experimental results show that the fretting fatigue limit ( 42 MPa ) is significantly reduced to approximately 47 % of the plain fatigue limit ( 89 MPa ) under 62.5 MPa contact pressure . 
Furthermore , the fretting fatigue life decreases with increasing alternating stress and increasing contact pressure . 
The examination results suggest that the stress concentrates induced by oxidation-assisted wear on the contact interface led to the earlier initiation and propagation of crack under the fretting condition.Aluminium cast alloys are used for engine components , such as pistons and cylinder heads . 
The micromechanical properties of an AlSi12 cast alloy under monotonic and cyclic loadings are investigated . 
Therefore a microstructure-based two dimensional finite element model is generated . 
The characteristic shape of primary precipitates is analyzed and translated into an artificial microstructure . 
The quality of the generated microstructure is evaluated based on the stress distribution along the primary particle boundaries . 
The effect of the temperature dependent material behavior of the aluminium matrix is studied with respect to the resulting stress distribution along the particle boundaries . 
The results are discussed in terms of a possible change of fracture mechanisms from a brittle type fracture at low temperatures to an increasingly ductile fracture at high temperatures.Abstract This paper deals with the study of the centrifugal effect on aluminum castings under high G values . 
In this study it will be shown that aluminum alloys , without reinforcement , and where there is almost no difference of density or low solubility of different phases , may also give rise to a Functionally Graded Material – FGM . 
It seems that the main variable that affects the mechanical and metallurgical properties is the fluid dynamics of the process . 
The effects of high Mg addition ( 2 wt % , 4 wt % and 6 wt % ) on the foaming behavior of AlSi7 based alloys were researched . 
The results show that Mg can react with Al_2O_3 phase and Si element , and then the produced MgAl_2O_4 phase which has a good wettability with Al melt and Mg_2Si phase are formed . 
Both of them can uniformly distribute in the alloy and induce a particle based stabilization mechanism , which can significantly reduce the negative impact of gravity drainage and capillarity . 
High Mg content can also change the pores formation in early stage , as a result , the pores grow and nucleate in a pool of liquid in a fairly spherical way . 
Therefore , a high expansion rate and good pore structures can be obtained . 
The disadvantage of high Mg content is the decrease of surface tension which makes pores easy to bust . 
A good trade-off between the beneficial and adverse effects of Mg content is 4 wt % for AlSi7 based alloy.The AlSi7Mg0.6 alloy is commonly used in foundry industry to produce high stressed automotive components like motor frames and cylinder heads . 
The properties of the material correspond directly to their microstructure which is given by the parameters of the solidification process . 
The effect of forced melt flow on the microstructure evolution in AlSi7Mg0.6 alloy during directional solidification is investigated experimentally . 
For that purpose a Bridgman-type gradient furnace is equipped with a rotating magnetic field to induce flow in the melt . 
As a result the forced melt flow substantially changes the dendritic solidification microstructure . 
Increasing intensity of the melt flow leads to axial macrosegregation and enrichment of silicon in the centre part of a sample . 
Here , this yields to a transition to mixed columnar-equiaxed or even to equiaxed growth , whereas in the out-of-centre region columnar dendritic growth persists . 
[ All rights reserved Elsevier ] In this work effect of cooling rate on the size of the grains , SDAS , size of the beta precipitation and thermal characteristic results of AC AlSi 7Cu 2 cast alloy have been described . 
The solidification process was studied using the cooling curve and crystallization curve at solidification rate ranging from 0.16degCs -1 up to 0.71degCs -1 . 
It was determined that the higher solidification rate increases the aluminum dendrite nucleation temperature and solid fraction at the dendrite coherency point , which implies that mass feeding is extended . 
In addition , it was observed that the non-equilibrium solidus temperature and the size of the grains , SDAS and size of the beta precipitation constituent decreases when the solidification rate increases . 
This work demonstrates that the thermal and chemical modification of the eutectic silicon can be quantitatively assessed by analysis of the cooling curve thermal characteristics . 
[ All rights reserved Elsevier ] .Efficiency increase of combustion engines in automotive development is directly related to improved material performance at high temperatures . 
In particular , the interaction of complex thermal and mechanical forces under service loading is one of the major factors affecting the lifetime . 
In this paper the aluminium cylinder head alloy AlSi6Cu4 is characterized concerning the high temperature low cycle fatigue ( LCF ) and thermo-mechanical fatigue ( TMF ) behaviour at temperatures between 200 and 400 degrees C. Two heat treatment modifications ( i.e . 
overaged condition , T7 , and a modified combined heat treatment , hot iso-static pressing ( HIP ) , prior to peak hardening according to T6 ) are compared to the T6 standard used in service . 
The strain amplitudes ranged between 0.2 to 0.7 % . 
For the standard T6 heat treatment LCF results at 400 degrees C indicate increased ductility and longer lifetimes compared to 200 degrees C. For the overaged microstructure and the modified treatment HIP + T6 under TMF exposure clear lifetime enhancements are observed which are significantly highest for the HIP + T6 version . 
Thus , the elimination of almost any microporosity reduces local stress concentrations and early crack initiation promoting failure.A burbling cooling technique used for preparing semi-solid alloys was presented.Water quenching specimens made of semi-solid AlSi9Mg alloy were prepared by which pin fins were put into a homemade sloping cooling device.The microstructures of the specimens were analyzed by the quantitative analysis technique.The influence of the shape , arrayed mode and arrayed pitch of pin fins on the microstructure of semi-solid AlSi9Mg alloy was studied.It is revealed that when the sectional shape of pin fins is water drop shaped , more α-Al phases with homogeneous microstructure and clear outline are obtained in the semi-solid alloy melt , showing spherical or nearly spherical shapes.The water quenching characteristics are the primary solid rate of 53.54 % , the grain size of 5.59 μm and the shape factor of 0.61.Different arrayed modes and different arrayed pitches of pin fins have great influence on the microstructure of the semi-solid AlSi9Mg alloy melt.The cross array has more advantages over the order array under the same conditions , and the ideal spacing is the one with line spacing S=15 mm and column spacing L=40 mm.The study presents the technological backgrounds of the process of melting and casting Al-Cr , Al-Ni , Al-Mo , Al-W and Al-Ti master alloys , used as refiners of the microstructure of cast silumins . 
Basing on the analysis of phase equilibrium diagrams for an Al-Me ( Cr , Ni , Mo , W , Ti ) system at a temperature of 900 o C , the characteristic intermetallic phases of Al x Me y were investigated . 
Most of the industry oriented research and development is based on conventional casting alloys Al-Si . 
This paper presents the results of deformation the hypoeutectic AlSi7Mg alloy used to manufacturing pistons for combustion engines . 
This is the material about high plasticity and corrosion resistance . 
For the research it was produced by semi-continuous casting process with magnetohydrodynamic stirring in crystalliser ( MHD ) and in conventional casting way . 
The results of deformation resistance of both materials have been described.A spiral test was used to evaluate the flowability of an AlSi7Mg0.6 alloy reinforced via 10-30 vol.- % SiC particles having average diameters of 9 , 13 , and 23 mum . 
The results show that the composite melt has the same ability to flow into long thin sections as unreinforced aluminium , when the particle content is & lt ; 20 vol.- % . 
The flowability of the particulate metal matrix composite is significantly reduced for particle volume fractions & gt ; 20 vol.- % and approaching 30 vol.- % as a result of increased increased viscosity . 
At these higher levels of SiC , an increase in pouring temperature can not compensate for the reduced flowability . 
The particle distribution in the solidified material depends on the length which the metal flows before solidification . 
After 150-200 mm of flow , dendritic grains growing in the composite melt push the particles so that the solidified microstructure consists of open areas without particles . 
The particle free areas increase in diameter with the flow distanceDiesel engines , characterized by higher breakout pressure and compression ratio in comparison with gasoline engines , require particularly elevated tensile properties for their engine parts.In order to maintain both high strength and high ductility in the cylinder head , i.e. , to obtain higher percent elongation without further reducing the tensile strength , AlSi9Cu1 alloy was used to prepare the cylinder head in an aluminum diesel engine.At the same time , the effect of different modification elements , Na or Sr , and Fe content on the reduction of secondary dendrite arm spacing ( SDAS ) was discussed , and the design of T7 heat treatment parameters were analyzed in order to improve the tensile ductility.The result shows : ( 1 ) The SDAS is as small as 18±3 μm for the Sr modified alloy . 
( 2 ) The percent elongation of the alloy with Sr modification increases by 66.7％ and 42.9％ , respectively , compared with the unmodified alloy and the alloy with Na modification . 
( 3 ) Lower Fe content alloy ( 0.10％ ) gives good results in percent elongation compared to the alloy with higher Fe content ( 0.27％ ) ; in particular , after Sr modification and T7 heat treatment , the elongation of over 5％ is obtained.Friction stir processing ( FSP ) was successfully applied to AlSi10Mg alloy produced by selective laser melting . 
The microstructure , microhardness , and room-temperature tensile property of the FSPed ... The block neutron absorber of B4C based on Al-Si eutectic alloy has been prepared by pow-der-metallurgy method.The effects of sinter temperature on microstructure , compressive strength , and ductil-ity of sintered billets have been investigated.It has been shown that the sintering temperature decides sensi-tively the compressive strength and ductility of sintered billets.Sintered under 550,555,560 , and 565 ℃ , the billet shows different states , such as sub-sintered , best-sintered , over-sintered , and molten.Sintered under 550 ℃ , the powder have not been metallurgically combined with each other.Beyond 560 ℃ , the billets are molten.The 555 ℃ is the best sintering temperature , under which the powder have been partly melted and the metallurgical combination has been occurred , then the billets have a better ductility . 
To prepare semi-solid AlSi9Mg alloy slurry , we simulated electromagnetic stirring ( EMS ) based on a coupled 3D model of electromagnetic field , temperature field , and flow field by sequentially coupling ANSOFT and FLUENT software . 
Results show that magnetic flux density and electromagnetic body force ( EMF ) decrease and exhibit non-uniform patterns as stirring frequency increases . 
However , magnetic flux density and EMF increase in proportion to the stirring current but become more inhomogeneous . 
As EMF increases , the flow velocity and the depth of vortex in the semi-solid slurry gradually increase ; thus , slurry temperature decreases . 
The deviation in temperature is then reduced between the center and the edge . 
As a result , the microstructure of the slurry evolves from coarse rosette grains to fine and spheroidal ones . 
By comparison , turbulent flow is generated by excessive and more unevenly distributed EMF , which causes deterioration in microstructures , such as the formation of cavities in the semi-solid AlSi9Mg alloy slurry . 
Based on simulation and experimental results , our conclusion is that reasonable process parameters have been obtained and verified experimentally . 
These results also show the validity and reliability of EMS-prepared semi-solid AlSi9Mg alloy.In this article , semi-solid AlSi7Mg alloy slurry was prepared by low superheat pouring and weak electromagnetic stirring . 
The effects of pouring temperature and stirring power on the microstructure of the AlSi7Mg alloy slurry were studied . 
The results showed that the semi-solid AlSi7Mg alloy slurry , 127 mm in diameter , could be prepared by using the low superheat pouring and weak electromagnetic stirring technology and this new technology could save energy and make the pouring process convenient . 
When the liquid AlSi7Mg alloy was poured at 650°C or 630°C , the solidified microstructure of the AlSi7Mg alloy slurry , prepared by weak electromagnetic stirring , was remarkably improved when compared with that of the slurry prepared without stirring . 
The primary α-Al grains appeared rosette-like or spherical . 
When the pouring temperature was decreased , the shape of the primary α-Al grains gradually changed from dendritic-like grains to spherical grains . 
When the pouring temperature was appropriately increased , that is , raised to a certain superheat , the pouring process became easier and an ideal spherical microstructure of the AlSi7Mg alloy slurry , prepared by weak electromagnetic stirring , could also be obtained . 
In this experiment , when the stirring power was 0.36 kW , the optimized pouring temperature parameter was 630°C . 
When the AlSi7Mg alloy slurry was prepared by low superheat pouring and weak electromagnetic stirring , the pouring temperature was 630°C . 
Increasing the stirring power appropriately could gain better spherical primary α-Al grains , but if the stirring power was increased to a certain value , the shape of the primary α-Al grains did not improve further . 
In this experiment , the optimized stirring power parameter was 0.36 kW.The microstructure evolution of AlSi7Mg alloy slurry in the semi solid zone has an important effect on AlSi7Mg alloy slurry viscosity , and is a main influencing factor of the inherent constitutive thixotropic behavior . 
The influencing factors , such as the degree of agglomeration among solid particles , particle size , particle morphology , and distribution of particle sizes , in AlSi7Mg alloy slurry microstructure evolution were described . 
The effect of AlSi7Mg alloy slurry microstructure evolution in the semi solid zone on AlSi7Mg alloy compression deformation was explored . 
[ Five Pr , Nd-free hyper-stoichiometric AB ( 5 ) metal hydride alloys , having nominal alloy compositions of La9.5Ce6.4Ni69.0-xCo4.7Mn4.3Al5.7CuxZr0.1Si0.3 ( x = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) with Cu partially substituting for Ni , were prepared by induction melting . 
The structure , chemical composition , gaseous phase hydrogen storage properties , and electrochemical properties of these alloys were investigated . 
Both the as-cast and annealed ( 960 degrees C for 10 h in vacuum ) alloys were made of a single CaCu5-type structure . 
Annealing improved the composition homogeneity , enlarged the crystallite size , and flattened the pressure-concentration-temperature isotherm . 
The occupancy site of Cu followed the sequence of 3g ( 1 at. % Cu ) - > 2c ( 2 and 3 at. % Cu ) - > 3g ( 4 at. % Cu ) . 
Improvement in activation and high-rate performance was demonstrated for the alloy containing 1 at. % Cu , but deterioration in the aforementioned properties were observed with higher Cu-content . 
With the incorporation of Cu , although the unit cell volume increased , both the gaseous phase and electrochemical hydrogen storage capacities decreased . 
1 at. % Cu-substituted alloy showed both higher bulk diffusion constant and surface exchange current than commercially available AB5 metal hydride alloys and was recommended for high-power nickel/metal hydride battery applications . 
( C ) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Several irradiation experiments of U ( Mo ) dispersion fuel performed with aluminum as matrix resulted in unacceptable swelling of the fuel plate due to the formation of an interaction layer between Al and U ( Mo ) . 
It was found that an improvement in fuel behavior can be achieved by adding Si to the Al matrix and creating a Si rich preformed layer which delays the formation of the interaction layer . 
Such Al-Si matrices can be formed either by mixing silicon powder with aluminum or using an AlSi alloy . 
AlSi alloy powders have very different mechanical properties which complicate fuel plate fabrication . 
Aging experiments on AlSi alloys reveal that giving the alloy the correct heat treatment results in a homogenous dispersion of fine Si precipitates in a soft and strain free Al matrix . 
The diffusion of such small precipitates towards the U ( Mo ) particles will be more effective than the transportation of Si from the larger Si particles used in a mixture matrix . 
Out of pile experiments are performed to show the difference between using a mixture or an alloy for the interaction with U ( Mo ) . 
It was found that the U ( Mo ) particles dispersed in an AlSi alloy matrix have a more uniform Si rich preformed layer after heat treatment .

AlSi ( 1 % ) is currently the dominant first level metalization used in production because of its low resistance and compatibility with conventional Si processes . 
The Ti and Cu are added to suppress hillocking and improve electromigration resistance . 
The results show that excellent planarization is achieved for all topologies including submicron contact hole structures , however , for the AlSi alloy spot ablation occurs which is characterized by the removal of metal . 
This is not seen for the AlSiCu and the AlSiTi alloys . 
The best morphology is obtained for the AlSiTi alloy with large areas completely free of ablation and pitting , which indicates that excellent planarization over large device areas can be achieved using this alloyThe Al-Si-Cu-Mg cast alloy was modified with additions of Ti-V-Zr to improve the thermal stability of intermetallics at increased temperatures . 
A combination of electron microscopy , electron backscatter diffraction , and high temperature X-ray diffraction was explored to identify phases and temperatures of their thermal stability . 
The micro-additions of transition metals led to formation of several ( AlSi ) ( x ) ( TiVZr ) phases with D0 ( 22 ) /D0 ( 23 ) tetragonal crystal structure and different lattice parameters . 
While Cu and Mg rich phases along with the eutectic Si dissolved at temperatures from 300 to 500 degrees C , the ( AlSi ) ( x ) ( TiVZr ) phases were stable up to 696-705 degrees C which is the beneficial to enhance the high temperature properties . 
Findings of this study are useful for selecting temperatures during melting and heat treatment of Al-Si alloys with additions of transition metals . 
( C ) 2014 Crown copyright and Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.The Al-Si-Cu alloy system is considered to be a promising choice of filler metal for aluminium alloys brazing due to its high strength and low melting point.The greatest obstacle is its lack of plastic forming ability and being difficult to be processed by conventional methods.This disadvantage is ascribed to the considerable amount of brittle CuAl2 intermetallic compound which forms when alloy composition is around the ternary eutectic point.In order to overcome this deficiency , authors of this article proposed to synthesize Al-Si-Cu filler metal by using in situ synthesis method , and the structure and properties of brazing joints were studied.The results show that AlSi alloy is used as the wrap layer , and CuAl alloy is used as the powder core in the composite brazing wire , the two alloys havesimilar melting points.The machinability of the composite brazing wire is much superior to the traditional Al-Si-Cu filler metal.During the induction brazing of 3A21 alloy , when using AlSi-CuAl composite filler wire , AlSi and CuAl alloys melt almost simultaneously , then after short time holding , AlSi-Cu braze filler is obtained , the brazing seam has uniform composition and good bonding interface , also , the shearing strength of the brazing joints is higher than the joint brazed by conventional Al-SiCu filler metal . 
Alumina–Aluminum composites with interpenetrating network structures are a new class of advanced materials with potentially better properties than composites reinforced by particles or fibers . 
Local casting reinforcement was proposed to take into account problems with the machinability of this type of materials and the shaping of the finished products . 
The centrifugal infiltration process fabricated composite castings in the form of locally reinforced shafts . 
The main objective of the research presented in this work was to compare the tribological properties ( friction coefficient , wear resistance ) of AlSi12/Al2O3interpenetrating composite layers with unreinforced AlSi12 matrix areas . 
Profilometric tests enabled both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the wear trace that formed on investigated surfaces . 
It has been shown that interpenetrating composite layers are characterized by lower and more stable coefficients of friction ( μ ) , as well as higher wear resistance than unreinforced matrix areas . 
At the present stage , the study confirmed that the tribological properties of the composite layers depend on the spatial structure of the ceramic reinforcement , and primarily the volume and size of alumina foam cells.AlSi-Ti five layered structure is prepared by sputtering on an oxidized silicon substrate . 
The resistivity , surface smoothness and microstructure is studied . 
It is observed that the layered structure exhibits a smooth hillock-free surface compared with the conventional AlSi alloy film . 
The effect of thermal annealing between 400 and 500degC on the properties of the layered structure is also reportedThe aim of this paper was to study the mechanical behavior of a hybrid AlSi–2 wt. % CNTs–5 wt. % SiCp composite . 
For comparison purposes the unreinforced AlSi alloy , AlSi–2 wt. % CNTs and AlSi–5 wt. % SiCp composites were used . 
A powder metallurgy processing route was used to produce the unreinforced AlSi alloy and AlSi composites . 
Tensile and fatigue tests were performed and the results showed that the hybrid composite AlSi–2 wt. % CNTs–5 wt. % SiCp proposed in the present paper , provided better overall properties than the single reinforcement composites . 
The improvement is attributed to the combined effects of two different reinforcements that act at different scales.This paper presents test results concerning the selection of sodium salt for the technology of continuous modification of the EN AC-AlSi 12 alloy , which is based on electrolysis of sodium salts , occurring directly in a crucible with liquid alloy . 
Sodium ions formed as a result of the sodium salt dissociation and the electrolysis are ‘ transferred ’ through walls of the retort made of solid electrolyte . 
Upon contact with the liquid alloy , which functions as a cathode , sodium ions are transformed into the atomic state , modifying the alloy . 
As a measure of the alloy modification extent , the obtained increase of the tensile strength R m and change of metallographic structure are used , confirming obtained modification effect of the investigated alloy.Different metal/ceramic composites ( Al7Si0.3Mg , Al3Ni , A16Ni , A19Ni ) reinforced with Al 2O 3 or ZrO 2 , were prepared by vortex method . 
Metallographic investigations reveal that in all the composites alpha-Al did not nucleate on the reinforcement particulates . 
The particulates were generally observed to be located in the last freezing regions regardless of matrix alloy , particulate type or size . 
The reason for that was the mismatch in the thermal diffusivity between the ceramic particulates and matrix alloys . 
SEM micrographs show that the presence of the particulates in the AlSi alloy tends to modify the silicon eutectic . 
In contrast , the addition of the particulates into AlNi alloys did not result in a significant modification of the NiAl 3 phase , but it displaced the eutectic point to lower Ni contentAbstract NiAl intermetallic phases were identified in AlCrFeCoNiCu alloy , indicating that the mixing entropy is not sufficient to inhibit the Al and Ni atoms from forming intermetallics in this alloy system . 
The AlCrFeCoNiCu alloy ingots were prepared by a vacuum arc melting the mixtures of pure Al , Cr , Fe , Co , Ni , and Cu with purities of better than 99.9 mass % in a Ti-gettered high-purity argon atmosphere . 
The ingots were remelted four times to improve homogeneity and then directly solidified in the cold copper hearth . 
A Hitachi S-5500 scanning electron microscope equipped with EDS was used to identify the element distribution of as-cast AlCrFeCoNiCu alloy in nanoscale . 
The AlCrFeCoNiCu alloy displays typical ferromagnetic behavior because of the decomposition of paramagnetic NiAl intermetallics and a magnetic solid solution . 
The ordered bcc phase was also detected in AlSiTiCrFeCoNiMo0.5 and AlSiTiCrFeCoNiMo0.5 alloys.U radu je opisan postupak zavarivanja aluminijskih legura u lijevanom stanju .

Prilikom zavarivanja legure AlSi4Cu3Mg2Zn2 ( Fe ) pojavile su se poprečne pukotine dok je legura AlSi12 pokazala dobru zavarljivost.Hydelko presents a new combination alloy for use in hypoeuctectic aluminium silicon foundry alloys . 
Strobloy simplifies today 's addition practice of grain refiner and modifier by reducing the number of additions from two to one . 
Strobloy is a combination product between the well-established TiBloy , and strontium . 
The alloy contains nucleating particles in the form of the mixed boride ( Al , Ti ) B , which is beneficial regarding settling and grain refining efficiency . 
Strontium is present as fast-dissolving ALSr particles . 
Trials carried out indicate that Strobloy shows very good performance compared to separate additions of TiBloy/AlTi5B1 and AlSr master alloy . 
The grain refining efficiency and modification level is the same or better . 
This paper displays results collected from tests done with different strontium levels in an A356 alloy . 
Comparisons to separate additions of TiBloy and AlSr are presented.ABSTRACT In this paper , the optimization of cutting parameters is investigated to assess surface roughness and cutting force in the end milling of AlSi/AlN metal matrix composite . 
Eighteen experiments ( L18 ) with five factors ( cutting speed , feed rate , depth of cut , volume of particle reinforcement , and type of coated insert ) were performed based on Taguchi designs of the experiment method . 
Two types of coating ( TiB2 and TiN/TiCN/TiN ) of the carbide cutting tool were employed to machine various volumes of AlN particle ( 5 % , 7 % and 10 % ) reinforced AlSi alloy matrix composite under dry cutting conditions . 
Signal-to-noise ( S/N ) ratio and analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) were applied to investigate the optimum cutting parameters and their significance . 
The S/N analysis of the obtained results showed that the optimum cutting conditions for the cutting force were ; A2 ( triple coating of the insert ) , B2 ( cutting speed : 200m/min ) , C1 ( feed rate : 0.6mm/tooth ) , D1 ( axial depth : 0.6mm ) and E1 ( 5 % reinforcement ) . 
At the mean time , the optimum cutting conditions for surface roughness were ; A1 ( single coating of insert ) , B3 ( cutting speed : 250m/min ) , C2 ( feed rate : 0.75mm/tooth ) , D1 ( axial depth : 0.6mm ) and E1 ( 5 % reinforcement ) .The study confirmed that , with a minimum number of experiments , the Taguchi method is capable of determining the optimum cutting conditions for the cutting force and surface roughness for this new material under investigation.A recent model that predicts the effect of solute content on grain size was shown to predict the effect of titanium additions on the grain size of pure aluminium and an AlSi7Mg0.3 alloy . 
The model assumes that nucleation on substrates is facilitated by constitutional undercooling in front of a growing grain . 
To determine how generally applicable the model is to a broad range of aluminium alloys , titanium additions were made to five wrought alloys containing the same level of TiB2 . 
It was found that the grain size obtained is a function of the reciprocal of mc 0 ( k-1 ) , the growth restriction factor , and that there is a lower limit to the grain size that can be achieved for the casting conditions used in the experiments . 
It was also found that at least stoichiometric levels of titanium are required for TiB2 particles to be effective nucleants.In this study , AlSi18CuNi-based metal matrix composites ( MMCs ) containing up to 12 wt. % of alumina short fibres were successfully synthesized using casting route . 
The structure of the produced composites and matrix alloy was examined using optical microscopy . 
At the same time , specimens from these alloys were machined and used for mechanical and wear tests . 
The results revealed that Al 2O 3 fibres refined the structure of AlSi18CuNi alloy . 
Also , metallography of the composites showed that the Al 2O 3 fibres were essentially uniformly distributed throughout the matrix . 
At the same time , the results showed that the mechanical properties and wear resistance of the as cast alloys were improved by the additions of alumina fibres . 
The composites showed an increase in tensile strength and hardness at ambient temperature over that of the matrix alloy . 
On the other hand , a decrease in tensile properties at elevated temperature of both matrix and composite alloys was noticed , but still the composites showed higher values compared with the matrix alloy . 
Pin on ring dry sliding test was carried out to study wear behaviour of the prepared alloys . 
Higher wear resistance was observed for the composites compared to the unreinforced alloy.Interconnectivity between eutectic silicon and short fibers in an AlSi12CuNiMg/Al2O3/15s composite increases with long‐term creep exposure time due to diffusion . 
It is also observed that the stationary creep rate decreases significantly compared to the initial stationary creep rate . 
Interconnectivity between rigid phases is analyzed and three‐dimensional statistical functions are applied to deduce the representative volume elements of the composite in different conditions . 
Unit cell geometrical models are generated to simulate the stationary creep behavior using the finite element method.An investigation of the structure formation of as-cast Al–11 wt % Si ( AlSi11 ) and Al–11 wt % Si–2 wt % Fe ( AlSi11Fe2 ) rapidly solidified ( RS ) ribbons is performed . 
Ribbon samples are examined in detail using Auger electron spectroscopy ( AES ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . 
A nanoscale thickness layer of Si-precipitations , at both Al-grains boundary and oxide/Al-matrix interface , is found to be characteristic for “ pure ” AlSi11 ribbons . 
For Fe-doped ribbons , this layer comprises Fe-containing phase also , which appears to possess amorphous nature and is situated between the Si-grains and Al-matrix . 
A possible mechanism of altering the thermally activated volume diffusion of elements , due to the effect of Fe on the structure modification , is speculated based on the obtained results.Based on SIMA , the Al-Si alloy semi-solid billets were successfully fabricated by means of strain inducement and isothermal treatment for AlSi9Mg poured in the range of near-liquidus . 
Through orthogonal test , the effects of combination action of near-liquidus casting , strain inducement and isothermal treatment on the morphology of primary α-Al phase of AlSi9Mg close to eutectic point were investigated , and the optimal match relation between the processing parameters of solidification , deformation parameters of strain inducement , processing parameters of isothermal treatment and microstructure parameters of semi-solid alloy was established . 
The results indicate that compared with the single near-liquidus casting or SIMA , the microstructure of primary α-Al phase in AlSi9Mg alloy prepared by compound fabrication process is more homogeneous , with more globular and finer particles , which has average grain size of 40-50 μm and shape factor of greater than 0.75 . 
After holding at 605 ℃ for 30-40 min under a certain cooling rate , increased deformation volume in SIMA benefits the refinement of the grain and the improvement of the morphology for primary phase . 
Anodic oxidation in the wall-jet electrode reactor was performed for three different cast aluminum substrates ( i.e . 
Al 99.80 wt. % , Al-10 wt. % Si , Al-10 wt. % Si-3 wt. % Cu ) in order to assess the evolution of electrode temperature under a broad range of current densities ( i.e . 
3.0-40 A dm -2 ) . 
Anodizing was carried out in 2.25 M H 2 SO 4 electrolyte at 25 degC under free and forced convection regimes . 
At current densities between 3.0 and 15 A dm -2 , corresponding to electrode temperatures lower than 60 degC , the temperature evolution showed the highest values for the AlSi alloy followed closely by the AlSiCu and Al substrates . 
At larger current densities and temperatures , the temperature sequence changed with the highest values recorded for Al followed by AlSi and AlSiCu alloys . 
In addition , under these conditions , the oxide layer thickness could not be further increased for any of the three compositions probably due to the severe effects of thermally enhanced field-assisted and chemical oxide dissolution . 
The changes observed in the thermal effects associated with anodizing of Al at large current densities ( i.e . 
15gesA dm -2 ) were related to the higher rates of conductive heat transfer for Al relative to the other two compositions . 
The forced convection regime determined a significant decrease in electrode temperature and an increase in oxide layer thickness and anodizing voltage for all three compositions investigated . 
[ All rights reserved Elsevier ] The following paper presents results of the researches on the influence of Sr addition on microstructure and mechanical properties of EN AC-Al Si9Cu3 ( Fe ) HPDC alloy . 
Two different elements were high pressure die cast for the research , one with Sr addition , second one without . 
Investigations involved light and scanning electron microscopy as well as hardness and tensile testing . 
EN AC-Al Si9Cu3 ( Fe ) HPDC alloy microstructure is characterized by a fine dendrites of α-Al solid solution and AlSi binary eutectic mixture . 
What is more , many intermetallic phases are observed in the alloy . 
These are : α-Al < sub > 15 < /sub > ( Fe , Mn , Cr ) < sub > 3 < /sub > Si < sub > 2 < /sub > , β-A < sub > 5 < /sub > FeSi , A < sub > 2 < /sub > Cu , π-A < sub > 8 < /sub > Mg < sub > 3 < /sub > FeSi < sub > 6 < /sub > and Q-A < sub > l5 < /sub > Mg < sub > 8 < /sub > Cu < sub > 2 < /sub > Si < sub > 6 < /sub > . 
Sr modified alloy is characterized by a significant volume fraction of fine , fibrous AlSi-eutectic . 
The porosity in the modified alloy slightly decreased . 
Mechanical properties of the alloy increased after Sr modification.One of the main goals of modern materials research is obtaining different microstructures and studying their influence on the mechanical properties of metals ; aluminum alloys are particularly of interest due to their advanced performance . 
Traditionally , their required properties are obtained by alloying process , modification , or physical influence during solidification . 
The present work describes a saturation of the overheated AlSi7Fe1casting alloy by oxides using oxygen blowing approach in overheated alloy . 
Changes in metals ’ microstructural and mechanical properties are also described in the work . 
An Al10SiFe intermetallic complex compound was obtained as a preferable component to Al2O3precipitation on it , and its morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscopy . 
The mechanical properties of the alloy after the oxygen blowing treatment are discussed in this work.The object of the studies was A390.0 alloy ( AlSi17Cu5Mg ) , similar to A3XX.X series , gravity cast into sand and metal moulds . 
This alloy is mainly used for cast pistons operating in I.C . 
engines , for cylinder blocks and housings of compressors , and for pumps and brakes . 
The A390.0 alloy was poured at temperatures 880 and 980°C , holding the melt for 30 minutes and casting from the temperature of 780°C . 
The assessment of the impact of the degree of overheating was to analysis the tensile strength . 
Studies were carried out on a normal-running fatigue testing machine , which was the mechanically driven resonant pulsator . 
For the needs of quantitative reliability evaluation and the time-to-failure evaluation , the procedures used in survival analysis , adapted to the analysis of failure-free operation with two-parametric Weibull distributions , were applied . 
Having determined the boundary value σ0 for Weibull distribution , the value of „ m ” modulus was computed along with other coefficients of material reliability , proposed formerly by the authors . 
Basing on the obtained results , a model of Weibull distribution function was developed for the tensile strength with respective graphic interpretation.The thermal analysis evolution of MgO-ZrO 2/NiCrAlY coatings on Ni metal and AlSi alloy ( LM13 ) substrates was studied . 
MgO-ZrO 2/NiCrAlY coatings were deposited on metallic substrates using an atmospheric plasma spray technique . 
The coatings were characterized by optical microscope and scanning electron microscope . 
Thermal loadings were applied to the model over the temperature range 800-1000degC using a finite element method . 
Metallographic examinations pointed out that coatings possessed porosity , oxides , unmelted and semi-melted particles , and inclusions . 
Finite element calculations showed that the stress concentration was at higher levels in coatings with AlSi substrates than that of Ni . 
It was also found that the larger residual stresses were obtained with an increase of the coating thickness and interlayer bond coatings decreased residual stressesPrimary AlSi10MnMg alloy is widely used for manufacturing of high ductility VPDC castings . 
This alloy combines low Fe with high Mn level to guarantee good ductility . 
Secondary alloys are cheaper but they contain a higher Fe content , which is detrimental to the ductility . 
Microadditions based on Mn have been found very effective in formation of less harmful α- iron compounds . 
In this study the effect of microstructure and casting defects on mechanical properties has been investigated in secondary alloy with 0.62 % Fe and moderate Mn . 
Mechanical properties similar to the primary alloy were obtained when specimens were free from casting defects.FeCoCrNiAlSi ( ͑x : molar ratio ; x = 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , and 2.0 at. % , respectively ) high-entropy alloy ( HEA ) coatings were synthesized with premixed high-purity Fe , Co , Cr , Ni , Al and Si powder on Q235 steel by using atmospheric plasma spraying and laser re-melting surface alloying , aiming to investigate the effects of different Si molar concentrations on the phase constituents , microstructure evolution , microhardness and properties of HEA coatings . 
These alloy coatings possessed BCC , FCC and CrSi structures . 
With the addition of Si , the alloy coatings were BCC and CrSi structures and the volume fraction of BCC ranged from 76.48 % to 91.97 % . 
The phase evolution , solid solution strengthening effect and the formation of hard CrSi phase increased the hardness of coatings from 500 HV to 1085 HV with the increase in Si content . 
When x = 2.0 , the coating had the lowest mass loss , reaching 0.008 g. The furrows on the worn surface were the shallowest , with the least amount of particles worn away , giving the best wear resistance . 
The main wear mechanism was abrasive wear in this work.This article presents research results of long-time cyclic oxidation of TiAlCrNb intermetallic alloy with and without an Al-Si coating . 
The coating was deposited by the Arc-PVD method in two steps . 
First the AlSi layer was deposited , and then the samples were heated in a vacuum chamber to form a diffusion TiAlSi coating . 
After coating deposition , the samples were heat treated in vacuum at 950degC for 2 h. Cyclic oxidation tests were carried out at 950degC . 
Heating time was 23 h and cooling was made in static air . 
Mass changes of the specimens were recorded after each cycle . 
A total of 60 cycles were performed . 
An analysis of the results achieved during cyclic oxidation was performed . 
Phase composition , morphology and distribution of elements in AlSi layers as well as in the scale were investigated using EDX , XRD and SEM . 
The results showed that Al-Si coatings were very effective in reducing the oxidation rate of gamma-TiAl especially during the first 40 cycles . 
The oxide formed on the coating after oxidation is composed of a mixture of a large portion of A1 2O 3 and a small portion of TiO 2 . 
After 40 cycles of oxidation the main component of the scale was rutile . 
Kirkendall voids were found in the coatingThe effects of AlTi5B1 grain refinement and cooling rate on the microstructure and mechanical properties of a secondary AlSi7Cu3Mg alloy were reported . 
Metallographic and image analysis techniques have been used to quantitatively examine the macrostructural and microstructural changes occurring with the addition of grain-refining agent at different cooling rates by using a step casting die . 
The results indicate that the addition of AlTi5B1 produces a fine and uniform grain structure throughout the casting and this effect is more pronounced in the slowly solidified regions . 
Increasing the cooling rate , lower amount of grain refiner is necessary to produce a uniform grain size throughout the casting . 
On the other hand , the initial contents of Ti and B , present as impurity elements in the supplied secondary alloy , are not sufficient to produce an effective grain refinement . 
The results from the step casting geometry were applied to investigate a gasoline 16V cylinder head , which was produced by gravity semi-permanent mould technology . 
The grain refinement improves the plastic behaviour of the alloy and increases the reliability of the casting , as evidenced by the Weibull statistics.Sheet materials , of thickness 2 mm , of the aluminium alloy AlSi1MgMn ( 6082 ) in the aging conditions T4 and T6 were laser beam welded with a CO2 laser using two different filler wires : a relative common filler AlSi7Mg and a new developed scandium-containing filler AlMg7Sc . 
To check the feasibility of a post-thermal treatment , the aging behaviour of the base material AlSi1MgMn in the conditions T4 and T6 , as well as the aging behaviours of the fusion zones AlSi1MgMn/AlSi7Mg and AlSi1MgMn/AlMg7Sc were investigated . 
For the base material AlSi1MgMn-T4 and the fusion zone AlSi1MgMn/AlSi7Mg , close square butt weld , a similar aging behaviour is found at moderate temperatures and durations . 
So aluminium welds with almost constant hardness profiles along the base material , heat affected zone , and fusion zone can be produced by post-aging the welded joint . 
For the base material AlSi1MgMn-T4 and the fusion zone AlSi1MgMn/AlMg7Sc , close square butt weld , the aging behaviour is different . 
At temperatures and durations necessary to form precipitates in the fusion zone , the base material is overaged . 
This behaviour could be improved for single V butt welds . 
A strong influence of the welding parameters on the aging behaviour of the fusion zone is found , because the amount of melted base and filler materials as well as the solidification rate determine the chemical composition and microstructure of the fusion zone in the as welded state.A novel TiNi/AlSi composite with high compressive strength and high damping capacity was obtained by infiltrating Al-12 % Si alloy into porous TiNi alloy.It had been found that the high compressive strength ( 440 MPa ) of TiNi/AlSi composite is due to the increase of effective carrying area after infiltrating Al-12 % Si alloy , while the high damping capacity is contributed to TiNi carcass , Al-12 % Si filling material and micro- slipping at the interface.Ceramic coatings were obtained by micro-arc oxidation ( MAO ) on surface of ZAlSi12 alloy in sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide electrolyte with addition of Ce ( NO_3 ) _3 . 
The effects of contents of Ce ( No_3 ) _3 in the range of 0～0.20 g/L in the electrolyte on microstructure and thickness of the ceramic coatings were investigated.The surface morphology of the coatings was observed by SEM and phases of the coatings were analyzed by XRD . 
The results reveal that thickness of the coatings increases with the increase of the content of Ce ( NO_3 ) _3 in the electrolyte to the maximum value of 170 μm when the content of Ce ( NO_3 ) _3 is 0.15 g/L . 
The coatings formed in the electrolyte containing Ce ( NO_3 ) _3 are still composed of α-Al_2O_3 and γ-Al_2O_ 3 phases , however , the amount of α-Al_2O_ 3 phase increases with the addition of Ce ( NO_3 ) _ 3 in electrolyte.The compound casting technique is a promising approach to achieve a higher level of efficiency in technologically advanced components . 
This paper presents a compound material that is suitable for reinforcing an AlSi10Mg alloy . 
The main emphasis is on developing a manufacturing technology to create a robust material bond between a high strength insert and casting . 
Considering both the strength properties and coefficient of thermal expansion , it was found that Fe–Al 40 at % intermetallics offer excellent potential for reinforcing AlSi castings . 
Different pre-treatments for cleaning the insert surface were investigated in experimental studies based on an understanding of the impeding effect of oxide layers . 
This paper examines three of these methods chemical pre-treatment using a flux , optical pre-treatment using laser ablation , and a combination of these techniques . 
The last method was found to be particularly successful . 
A metallographic examination , CT and EDX analyses , but also three-point bending tests suggested that the combined treatment could provide a reproducible and satisfactorily robust bond between the Fe-Al insert and AlSi bulk material.Metallographic microscope ( OM ) , scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) , hardness and tensile properties were used to investigated the microstructure and mechanical properties of Al-Si alloy by gravity casting and by squeeze casting with different pressure , and the microstructure evolution and its mechanism were described.The results show that , there exist bright white short rod like Al2 Cu phase , white fishbone AlSiCuMg phase , black massive primary silicon phase and gray coral shaped eutectic silicon phase in the gravity casting Al-Si alloy.The primary silicon phase in squeeze casting Al-Si alloy is decreased with the increase of the pressure ratio , while the size is refined gradually , and the Al2 Cu and AlSiCuMg phase are decreased with refinement in grain size.Brinell hardness of squeeze cast Al-Si alloy are the higher than that of gravity casting Al-Si alloy , and with the increase of the extrusion ratio , the hardness of the alloy is increased firstly and then decreased.Compared with those of gravity casting AlSi alloy , the tensile strength and elongation are increased by 25.4 % and 202.1 % , respectively for squeeze cast Al-Si alloy with 600 MPa pressure.Abstract The results obtained after the application of a non-destructive technique to determine the modification rating of AlSi alloys are presented . 
Research focused on the effect of antimony concentration over modification rating in an AlSi hypoeutectic alloy , via ultrasonic attenuation . 
The ultrasonic attenuation was determined at frequencies of 1,2.25 , 5 and 10 MHz . 
Results showed that attenuation decreases significantly as the concentration of antimony in the alloy increases . 
A linear correlation between attenuation and modification rating is presented , where attenuation decreases progressively as the silicon structure becomes finer . 
Results are compared for the alloy without alloying elements and with controlled grain size.High-strength automotive components are often made of AlSi7-based alloys . 
A very challenging problem with aluminium casting is the influence of melt flow during solidification , because it affects the microstructure formation and therefore the material properties . 
The scope of this paper is to investigate the effect of forced melt flow on the evolution of the dendritic microstructure in a binary AlSi7 alloy during directional solidification . 
Global modelling using the software CrysMAS provides typical flow patterns and velocities . 
These values are used as boundary condition for the flow in the phase field code MICRESS , which allows the numerical simulation of dendritic array solidification in 2D with applied flow . 
From solidification experiments in a gradient furnace with applied rotating magnetic field the dendrite shapes are determined . 
It is found consistently that intense melt flow leads to asymmetric dendrite shapes and the growth behaviour of the dendrite arms is directly correlated with the flow direction.Due to the increasing international competition and the resulting pricing pressure it is imperative to avoid the use of expensive alloying elements during the production of aluminium castings . 
The piston alloy A 332 shows an optimum combination of mechanical and casting properties and an attractive cost-performance ratio whereas nickel is the most expensive alloying element . 
A substitution of nickel by a combined addition of low contents of cobalt and zirconium has the potential capacitiy to increase the mechanical properties and reduce the costs of the alloy . 
At Clausthal University of Technology Thermo-Calc simulations and casting experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of the nickel subtitution . 
Thermo-Calc-simulations were made to analyze the intermetallic phases in these alloys . 
These simulations were evaluated by observations under optical microscope and SEM of specimens poured into permanent moulds . 
The size and morphology of the intermetallic phases and the primary silicon was analyzed by the use of image analysis software . 
The mechanical properties of the alloys were determined by tensile tests at room temperature , 250° C and 350° C. The tensile specimens were tested in as-cast and pre-aged condition . 
The effect on the castability was characterized by determining the flow length and the susceptibility to form shrinkages and hot cracks . 
The standard alloy A 332 and the new piston alloy with cobalt and zirconium were compared . 
The new alloy AlSi12,6Cu1Mg1CoZr exhibits a yield strength of 115 MPa and a tensile strength of 171 MPa at 250° C in pre-aged condition ( 250° C/100 h ) . 
At 350° C the new alloy displays a yield strength of 57 MPa and a tensile strength of 85 MPa in pre-aged condition ( 350° C/100h ) . 
Compared to the reference alloy AlSi12,6Cu1Ni1Mg1 the yield strength at 250° C was improved about 25 % and the yield strength at 350° C about 7 % . 
The favorable castability of the reference alloy is not affected by the substitution of nickel . 
These results prove the development of a heat-resistant , thermally stable alloy without nickel . 
The mechanical properties and the cost-performance ratio are superior to the standard alloy . 
The competitiveness of the new piston alloy was improved significantly.It is believed that particle cracking resulting from phase transformation is responsible for the poor cycle performance of lithium alloy anodes . 
Pulverization effects may be reduced by using , ( i ) smaller active particles ; ( ii ) active particle composites with different potentials for the onset of lithium alloy formation ; and ( iii ) expanded alloys which have undergone a major increase during initial charging . 
Three alloys of the above types ( nano-Sn , AlSi 0.1 and Li 4.4Sn ) were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( IS ) to determine their electrochemical kinetics and intrinsic resistance during initial lithium insertion-extraction . 
The electrodes were prepared by sandwiching a disk of active powder between two nickel screens , so that the contact resistance may be determined by EIS and from a DC voltage difference across the electrode ( trans-electrode voltage ) . 
A large increase in contact resistance was found during lithium discharge ( extraction ) from nano-Li xSn and Li xAlS 0.1 alloys , compared with the small increase during the initial charge . 
This result suggests that the matrix materials should have a small coefficient of elasticity to give low stress on expansion of the active alloy , together with a large elastic deformation to compensate for volume reduction . 
EIS results for measurement of intrinsic resistance and reaction kinetics during initial lithium insertion into nano-Sn and AlSi 0.1 alloys show that both solid electrolyte interphase ( SEI ) films formed on particle surfaces , together with particle pulverization , are responsible for the high contact resistanceThe paper investigates the corrosion behavior of AlSi10Mg alloy produced by direct metal laser sintering ( DMLS ) . 
Potentiodynamic tests were performed in aerated diluted Harrison solution , on specimens with different orientation with respect to the building plane . 
Different surface finishing were analyzed , covering rough surfaces as produced by DMLS and after polishing by means of emery papers and alumina slurry or chemical polishing with phosphoric and nitric acid bright dipping ( BD ) . 
A conversion treatment by short immersion in Ce ( III ) salt solution was evaluated in order to improve corrosion resistance of both as-produced surface and polished surface . 
Selective attack of α-Al phase occurs at the border of the melting pools , typical of DMLS process , and slightly reduces on transversal planes , perpendicular to the building plane . 
Acid pickling slightly improves the corrosion resistance of as-produced surface , but no positive effects were noticed on polished one . 
The Ce ( III ) conversion treatment does not inhibit corrosion on as-produced specimens . 
Its effectiveness is higher on polished and pickled specimens . 
On polished surface , the effectiveness of conversion treatment mainly depends on plane orientationGrain structures observed in most casting processes of metallic alloys are the result of a competition between the growth of several arrays of dendrites that develop under constrained and unconstrained conditions . 
Often this leads to a transition from columnar to equiaxed grain growth during solidification ( CET ) . 
A microgravity environment results in suppression of buoyancy-driven melt flow and so enables growth of equiaxed grains free of sedimentation and buoyancy effects . 
This contribution presents first results obtained in experiments on-board the International Space Station ( ISS ) , which were performed in the frame of the ESA-MAP programme CETSOL . 
Hypoeutectic aluminium-silicon alloys with and without grain refiners were processed successfully in a low gradient furnace ( MSL-LGF ) . 
First analysis shows that in the non grain refined samples columnar dendritic growth exists , whereas CET is observed in the grain refined samples . 
From analysis of the thermal data and the grain structure the critical parameters for the temperature gradient and the cooling rate describing CET are determined . 
These data are used for initial numerical simulations to predict the position of the columnar-to-equiaxed transition and will form a unique database for calibration and further development of numerical CET-modeling.This experimental study is concerned with the influence of metallic ( Ti ) and ceramic ( SiC ) reinforcements in an aluminumfsilicon ( AlSi ) alloy , when regarding tensile properties and wear behavior . 
Several micron sized particulate reinforced composites were produced by hot-pressing technique : AlSi-SiC and AlSi-Ti composites and AlSi- ( Ti-SiC ) hybrid composites . 
Regarding tensile properties , all composites presented higher ultimate tensile strength ( UTS ) than the AlSi matrix , with the highest UTS being attained by a hybrid composite ( AlSi-11.25 % Ti-5 % SiC ) . 
Regarding wear behavior , reciprocating pin-on-plate wear tests were performed for unreinforced AlSi ; AlSi-Ti composites and AlSi- ( Ti SiC ) hybrid composite against a gray cast iron ( GO ) counterface . 
The wear mechanisms for all the tested tribopairs are presented and discussed . 
It was observed that the wear behavior of the AlSi-Ti/GCI and also AlSi- ( Ti-SiC ) /GCI tribopairs are improved when compared with the AlSi/GCI system . 
AlSi-11.25 % Ti-5 % SiC hybrid composite exhibited the highest improvement in wear rate . 
( C ) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.In paper problem concerning inoculation of primary structure of Al with purity of 99,5 % and 99,8 % and AlSi 2 alloy , which is realized mainly by intensification of liquid metal movement in mould is presented . 
In aim of realization of forced movement during the crystallization of liquid metal was used horizontal electromagnetic field produced by the induction coil ( stirrer ) supplied by current with elevated frequency . 
The degree of structure refinement was represented mainly by equiaxed crystals zone content on transverse section of ingot and average area of macro-grain in this zone . 
Effect of structure refinement obtained by influence of electromagnetic stirring was compared with refinement obtained by use of traditional inoculation , which consists in introducing of additives i.e . 
titanium , boron and strontium to metal bath . 
The results of studies and their analysis show possibility of effective refinement of pure Al and Al-Si alloy primary structure , only with use of horizontal electromagnetic field and without necessity of application of inoculants such a Ti and B . 
This method of inoculation is important , because inoculants decrease the degree of purity and electrical conductivity of pure Al . 
Moreover inoculants are reason of point cracks formation during rolling of ingots.An excimer laser beam is focused ( 1-3 Jcm 2 ) on to an aluminium alloy ( AlSi7Mg ) surface target in a nitrogen atmosphere ( 760 Torr ) . 
A nitride layer ( 5 mm 2 area per laser spot ) is obtained by nitrogen diffusion in the bulk with a depth of several micrometres during the induced laser-plasma time interaction on the surface . 
For chemical , structural and tribological analyses , 1times1 cm 2 samples are processed by scanning the laser beam on the surface , either by locating the laser-plasma spots side by side or by overlapping them . 
Different experimental conditions are investigated ( laser fluence , laser pulse number , overlapping rate of laser-plasma spots ) , and then various analysis such as NRA , XRD , GIXD , SEM , EDS are performed . 
When a step-by-step process is used , the nitrogen concentration appears to be inhomogeneous depending on the surface location , and the surface roughness is too high for further applications . 
Nevertheless , the overlapping process yields homogeneous chemical composition layers with smooth surfaces . 
Tests are performed to characterise the friction behaviour of the treated surface under fretting conditions , and tribological results clearly indicate the best experimental conditions to be used for the enhancement of mechanical propertiesTrisilanol phenyl polyhedral silsesquioxane ( phenyl TSP ) was added to a commercial aluminum alloy , AlSi10MnMg , to investigate its influence on microstructure , mechanical properties , and ... Abstract The energy absorption of high-pressure die-cast AlSi4MgMn and AlSi9MgMn alloy samples is investigated in the as-cast , and solutionised and 4 h aged condition using a shear bolt test . 
The shear bolt test is not a standard technique to test the properties of the material , but can be used to evaluate the energy absorption of the material . 
The microstructures of the as-cast and heat-treated specimens are examined . 
The fracture surfaces are investigated using scanning electron microscopy to understand the fracture mechanism during the shear bolt tests . 
The heat treatment is expected to give better properties owing to , i.e. , spheroidisation of Si particles and subsequent age hardening due to the presence of Mg in the alloy . 
It is observed that there is 10–30 % improvement in energy absorbing capacity of the material after ageing.This paper presents the results of an investigation using transmission electron microscopy concerning the structure of AlSi7Cu2 cast aluminium alloy after alloying and remelting with a high power diode laser ( HPDL ) . 
In particular , the changes in the particle/precipitation type , size and shape were determined , concerning especially the SiC and TiC particles added to the initial material . 
The aim of this work was also to present the laser treatment technology which will be used for further alloying and remelting with ceramic powders – especially carbides and oxides . 
The innovatory arrangement of this investigation is based on the mixing of two different powders , which were fed simultaneously to the laser-treated aluminium surface . 
The overview focuses on the laser power required to achieve good layer hardness to prevent hot work tool steel from losing its work stability and to make the tool surface more resistant to action in external conditions.The secondary foundry alloy of the type AlSiCuZnFe is one of the most common materials for several applications , mainly in the automotive industry . 
The main alloy within the AlSiCuZnFe family is the foundry alloy A226 ( AlSi9Cu3 ( Fe ) ) , which is a recycling alloy . 
The relatively low ductility of A f 12 % in the as-cast state , just by varying the alloying elements . 
This microstructureproperty relationship is interpreted in the light of thermodynamic calculations and metallographic investigations.AlSi10Cu0.2Mg0.2Mn-xLa and ZnAl12Cu1 ( Mg ) -x La casting alloy were prepared by Al-La master alloy . 
The effect of La content on the microstructure , tensile strength , elongation and impact strength of these alloys were investigated .

1wt % ~ 0 . 
2wt % .With orthogonal tests the effects of grain refiners and modifiers , Al-10Sr , rare earth ( RE ) and Al-Ti-5B , on the mechanical properties of Al-Si alloy for automobile cylinder blocks were studied . 
The best result occurred when the proportion of refiners and modifiers was Al-10Sr = 0.1wt % , RE = 0.3wt % , Al-5Ti-B = 0.8wt % . 
With SEM and EDS the as-cast microstructures of materials after grain refining and modification were observed and analyzed . 
Tiny branch-shaped AlSi phase , thin-striped AlCu phase , new small bone-shaped AlSiMn phase , new leaf-shaped or feathered B ( AlCuCe ) phase as well as the phases of other metal compounds made the as-cast microstructures more complicated and more compact after grain refining and modification . 
Some brittle phases reduced in size obviously and distributed in the grain boundaries of plastic Î±-phase in network , which acted as intercrystalline strengthening to certain degree . 
During the tensile deformation these brittle phases could reduce the stress concentration , impeded dislocation movement , and then strengthened the alloy matrix . 
In addition after grain refining and modification the porosity was significantly reduced.Micro-arc oxidation coating on ZAlSi12Cu2Mg1 alloy were prepared in Na2SiO3 electrolyte , effects of C6H8O7 and C3H8O3 as additive on resistances of micro-arc oxidation coatings were investigated . 
Results show that coatings containing completest ceramic particles were obtained on alloys surface processed in electrolyte solution including 2.0 g/L C6H8O7 additive , the size of micro-arc wholes becomes larger with more C6H8O7 , and it has improved with 1ml/L C3H8O3 in the solution . 
The results of XRD analysis indicates that the coatings are mainly composed of alumina and mullite . 
EDS analysis showed the element contains sodium , oxygen , silicon and aluminum . 
Wear resistance of coating were increased by adding C3H8O3.The study evaluates mechanical properties of APM particulate aluminum foams built up from adhesively bonded Al foam spheres . 
Foams of matrix alloy AlSi10 are compared , with PM AlSi7 foams used as reference . 
The influence of density is studied both for quasi-static and dynamic compressive loading in a range from â¼0.35 to 0.71âgâcmâ3 . 
The effect of varying the bonding agent is evaluated for a single density and both strain rate levels by replacing the standard , high-strength epoxy-based adhesive with a polyamide of greatly increased ductility . 
The result is a clear shift of fracture events to higher strain levels , as well as the introduction of a strain-rate dependency of strength.When the matrix alloy of an AlSi7Mg-SiC composite has been modified with antimony , the wetting properties of the system deteriorate . 
Using transmission electron microscopy and microanalysis it was found that this is probably related to the formation of a film-like amorphous antimony-rich oxide at the matrix-silicon carbide interfaces . 
Associated with this compound are pores at the interfaces . 
The film-like compound is generally intermixed with magnesium-aluminium spinel crystallites at the interfaces and with the neighbouring matrix . 
No antimony-rich phase is found away from the interfaces.AlSi-Al₂O₃composite layer was prepared by plasma spray on steel substrate . 
The composite powder for plasma spray was prepared by simple mechanical blending .

The heat-treated AlSi7Mg0.3 alloy is the standard wheel alloy as it offers the best compromise between fatigue strength and elongation . 
Alloys with less than 7 wt % Si may also be of interest for the ... This study investigates the influence of cutting parameters on longitudinal turning of high Silicon cast aluminium alloy AlSi9Cu3 using PCD tools with and without chip breaker geometry . 
In order to build the 3D numerical model , the experimental and predicted cutting forces were used for inverse calibration of the Johnson–Cook material model which was implemented in DEFORM TM finite element software . 
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to obtain an acceptable prediction of the machining parameters such as chip geometry and cutting forces as well as to understand the influence of friction and mesh size effects in the predicted results . 
Results have shown a satisfactory correlation between experimental turning data and numerical estimates based on assumptions that have been taken for the material behaviour.We present methods and results for the simulation of faceted and dendritic crystal growth . 
Using a thermodynamically realistic isothermal alloy model for AlSi we demonstrate , in confirmation of experimental observations , a change in morphology from perfectly faceted hexagons at smaller undercooling to dendritic growth at larger undercoolings . 
We also demonstrate that there exists a cut off temperature which separates the two distinct morphologies , and indeed hybrid morphologies . 
These results suggest that the mechanism for morphology variation observed experimentally primarily lies in anisotropic surface free energy modelling , which we adopt in preference to kinetic anisotropy.The increasing demand for light weight and efficiency of modern combustion engines requires sophisticated light alloys with improved high-temperature strength and creep resistance . 
Nowadays AlSi alloys are used for structural parts as these materials offer increased wear resistance and long-term stability under operating conditions . 
The heterogeneous microstructure of AlSi combines the thermal properties of stiff Si particles with ductile alpha-Al into a composite with sophisticated thermomechanical strength . 
However , the different Young 's moduli and coefficients of thermal expansion cause large microstress gradients and microcrack formation in service . 
The micromechanical deformation mechanisms in AlSi systems , responsible for crack initiation and growth , are unknown so far . 
The current work describes an experimental approach that combines non-destructive diffraction and imaging techniques to investigate the elastoplastic deformation behavior of two engineering alloys , i.e . 
the hypoeutectic AlSi7MgCu standard alloy for castings and the hypereutectic AlSi17Cu4 piston alloy for improved surface wear resistance . 
Neutron diffraction is applied for microstress measurements under external load and during thermal cycling . 
Complementary synchrotron tomography is performed for imaging of microcrack formation and damage within the microstructure . 
Stress-induced micromechanical deformation mechanisms could be revealed and correlated to damage mechanisms critical for engine components under operating conditions .

The novel process is intended to permit efficient purification of the AlSi casting alloys having charge weights of up to 5 tonnes in a single crucible . 
According to the proposed process , the molten AlSi is subjected , after two-stage vacuum treatment assisted by flushing gas , to a vibration treatment or shaking treatment for several hours . 
In this way , it is possible markedly to reduce the gas content and/or impurity content of the melt and hence considerably to improve the quality of the cast alloy . 
Refining of AlSi casting alloys.In this paper , pure Nd was adopted to modify hypereutectic aluminum-silicon alloy ( Al-20 % Si ) . 
The morphology of eutectic and primary silicon phases was analyzed by OM and SEM . 
OM and SEM results show that pure Nd ( 0.3 wt. % ) can significantly refine both eutectic and primary silicon of hypereutectic Al-20 % Si alloy . 
Morphology of primary silicon was transformed from star-shaped and irregular morphology to fine polyhedral and grain size of primary silicon was refined from 80-120 mum to 20-50 mum . 
TEM results show that a new needle shape ternary phase ( AlSi xNd y ) forms in modified alloy . 
XRD results show that three little unknown diffraction peaks appear after Nd modification and it is induced that they should be diffraction peaks of ternary AlSi xNd y intermetallic phase in the modified alloy by analyzing both TEM and XRD results . 
Friction and wear resistance tests show that friction coefficient of Al-20 % Si alloy decreases after Nd modification . 
Wear resistance of Al-20 % Si alloy after 0.3 wt. % Nd modification was significantly improved as compared to the initial sample . 
The improvement of wear resistance was mainly attributed to change of morphology , size and distribution of eutectic silicon and primary silicon after Nd modification . 
The dominant wear mechanism for 0.3 wt. % Nd modified alloy was abrasive wear , adhesive wear and oxidative wear mechanism , but wear mechanism for unmodified alloy was abrasive wear and adhesive wear mechanism . 
[ All rights reserved Elsevier ] .This paper preliminarily explored and proved the feasibility of fabricating semisolid thixoforming billets for a hypereutectic Al-Si alloy ( AlSi29Fe3 ) by severe plastic deformation ( SPD ) and semisolid remelting . 
In this paper , friction stir processing ( FSP ) was used to refine the coarse primary silicon particles and needle-shaped iron-rich phase of the hypereutectic Al-Si alloy . 
The results show that the semisolid thixoforming billets obtained by the above route contain fine spherical Al grains with mean size of 34mum , and second-phase particles ( both primary silicon and iron-rich intermetallic ) of less than 10mum . 
The microstructure is ideal non-dendritic semisolid structure . 
Therefore , SPD and remelting is a promising technology for the fabrication of semisolid thixoforming billets of the hypereutectic Al-Si alloy.Investigations into the fretting behaviour of the AlSi7Mg-T6 aluminium alloy are presented . 
With regard to the surface finishing conditions of the material , two types of specimen were considered : ( i ) machined and ( ii ) machined and shot peened specimens . 
The research was focused on investigations into the influence of the number of cycles , normal load ( contact pressure ) and the amplitude of slip on the fretting behaviour of the material . 
Fretting tests were performed under various running conditions with regard to normal load levels and slip amplitudes . 
The coefficient of friction between the surfaces at the fretting junction was continuously recorded . 
The fretting damage on the aluminium specimens was studied by means of microscopic and EPM analyses . 
With regard to the evolution of coefficient of friction curves , two modes of fretting process were identified . 
They differ in the transition from the initial phase to the steady-state fretting regime and depend primarily on the severity of the running conditions and the material properties . 
In general , higher values of the coefficient of friction were observed with machined and shot peened specimens as compared with those which were machined . 
It was found that for a given normal load , the coefficient of friction increases with an increased amplitude of slip while , for a given amplitude of slip , it decreases with an increased normal loadThe effect of varying the major alloying elements within the limits of specification on the solidification behavior , fluidity , and microstructure of a 380 alloy has been studied at two cooling rates . 
The thermal analysis technique has been used to study the solidification behavior . 
The alloying elements investigated ranged from 3.22 to 4.09 pct copper , 1.01 to 1.70 pct iron , 0.06 to 0.50 pct magnesium , 1.69 to 3.00 pct zinc , and 0.16 to 0.46 pct manganese . 
The results show that the solidification behavior of the 380 alloys is complicated , and the cooling curve at 0.4degC/s indicates six reactions taking place during the process of solidification . 
Cooling curves obtained for each of the alloying element additions , their analysis , and the resultant microstructures are discussedThe effect of rotational and travelling speeds and down force on the torque in Friction Stir Processing ( FSP ) process are presented . 
To find a dependence combining the spindle torque acting on the tool with the rotational speed , travelling speed and the down force , the artificial neural networks have been applied . 
Studies have shown that the increase in the rotational speed causes decrease in the torque while the increase in the travelling speed and down force causes the increase in the torque at the same time . 
The relationship between parameters of the process and the temperature of the tool , based on measurement head TermSTIR , were presented . 
Tests were conducted on casting aluminium alloy AlSi9Mg . 
Application of FSP process resulted in a decrease in the porosity in the modified material and microstructure refining.The analysis of deformation and damage behavior of aluminum cast components is very complex , since local mechanical properties in the components are inhomogeneous as a consequence of spatial distribution of microstructure e.g . 
pore size , grain size and arm spacing of secondary dendrites . 
Moreover , the damage behavior of aluminum alloys depends strongly on stress state . 
Until now it is not clear how the pore morphology affects the damage behavior under different loading situations . 
In this work the damage behavior of the aluminum die casting alloy AlSi9Mn was characterized with tension specimens extracted from different positions in a component . 
Damage effect was modeled with representative volume elements ( RVE ) with variation of porosity , pore size and distribution of pores under uniaxial and biaxial tension , plane strain , compression and shear . 
Not only pore growth and coalescence but also damage of the matrix material was taken into account in the simulations . 
A large influence of pore morphology on fracture strain was found and relationships between fracture strain and pore morphology were proposed for different stress states.Porosity generated by the casting process has a detrimental effect on the high cycle fatigue strength of cast aluminium alloys . 
The current study presents an investigation using the non-destructive X-ray micro-tomography technique of the effect of the size and the population of casting pores on the fatigue strength of the AlSi7Mg0.3 alloy . 
This alloy was obtained by the lost foam casting process , which leads to a ” high ” volume fraction of porosity . 
Observations by micro-tomography , realized on specimens containing fatigue cracks , highlight an important role of the pore distance to the specimen surface in addition to the pore size . 
In the second part , the local mechanical response around real 3D pores is investigated thanks to finite element models using an elasto-plastic material behaviour law for the aluminium matrix . 
A critical volume approach based on the Dang Van criterion to predict the fatigue limit is introduced and shows good agreement with the experimental data . 
The effect of the pore geometry on the Dang Van equivalent stress distribution around individual pores is also investigated.In order to widen the alloy spectrum for the laser powder bed fusion process , apart from the popular Al-Si-based alloys , AlSi10Mg and AlSi12 , the precipitation-hardenable AA2099 wrought alloy has ... Laser beam welding of a newly developedAA2060 aluminum–lithium ( Al-Li ) alloy was performed with AlSi12 filler wire . 
The fusion zone ( FZ ) consisted of dendritic solidification structure with the LiAlSi and CuAl2phases and a small quantity of Mg2Si phase at the dendritic and grain boundaries , reducing the precipitation ability in the interior of grains . 
The microhardness was decreased in the FZ , being 90–120 HV0.1 , compared to the based material ( BM ) , being 152 HV0.1 , and the variation was consistent with local strength across the joint . 
The joint transverse tensile strength was 416MPa and the elongation was 1.2 % . 
The presence of grain boundary phases caused the fracture mode varied from a low–energy intergranular fracture in the FZ to a high–energy transgranular fracture in the BM . 
The formation of LiAlSi phases in the weld metal , resulting from the addition of Si , helped increase the tensile strength of the joints . 
TheAA2060 Al-Li alloy is considered weldable due to the over 80 % tensile strength of BM in laser beam welding , which readily meets most applications.This paper presents results of structural , mechanical and tribological tests of thixocast hypoeutectic Al-Si alloy A356 ( EN AlSi7Mg0.3 ) . 
The pin-on-disc tribometer was used to carry out tribological tests under dry sliding conditions at different loads . 
Two sets of specimens were used as pin materials . 
The first one was taken from the original alloy billet and the second one from thixocast alloy . 
Heat treatment was applied on both sets of specimens . 
The results showed that , for all applied loads , heat treatment improved tribological properties , while improvements caused by additional thixocasting were not systematic , i.e . 
lower friction coefficient was noticed just for lower specific loads . 
Overall better wear resistance of thixocast materials , compared to the originally alloy , was attributed mainly to their higher silicon content . 
[ All rights reserved Elsevier ] .The effects of grain refinement on the microstructure and mechanical properties of a secondary AlSi7-Cu3Mg gravity die cast cylinder head are reported . 
Metallographic and image analysis techniques have been used to quantitatively examine the macro- and microstructural changes occurring with the addition of grain-refining agent . 
The results indicate that the AlTi5B1 addition produces a fine and uniform grain structure throughout the casting ; this effect is more pronounced in the slowly solidified regions . 
The initial contents of Ti and B , which are present as impurity elements in the supplied secondary alloy ingots , are not sufficient to produce effective grain refinement . 
Under the present casting conditions , the combined addition of AlTi5B1 and Sr does not produce any reciprocal interaction or effect on primary alpha-Al and eutectic solidification . 
Grain refinement improves the mechanical properties of the as-cast AlSi7Cu3Mg alloy and produces higher Weibull moduli , thus increasing the reliability of the casting . 
For automotive structural components , this could be considered an increase in safety.Detailed investigations of the salient microstructural features and casting defects of the high-pressure die-cast ( HPDC ) AlSi9Cu3 ( Fe ) alloy are reported . 
These characteristics are addressed to the mechanical properties and reliability of separate HPDC tensile bars . 
Metallographic and image analysis techniques have been used to quantitatively examine the microstructural changes throughout the tensile specimen . 
The results indicate that the die-cast microstructure consists of several microstructural heterogeneities such as positive eutectic segregation bands , externally solidified crystals ( ESCs ) , cold flakes , primary Fe-rich intermetallics ( sludge ) , and porosities . 
In addition , it results that sludge particles , gas porosity , as well as ESCs , and cold flakes are concentrated toward the casting center while low porosity and fine-grained structure is observed on the surface layer of the castings bars . 
The local variation of the hardness along the cross section as well as the change of tensile test results as a function of gage diameter of the tensile bars seem to be ascribed to the change of porosity content , eutectic fraction , and amount of sludge . 
Further , this behavior reflects upon the reliability of the die-cast alloy , as evidenced by the Weibull statistics.High pressure die casting ( HPDC ) is a kind of near net shape manufacturing method . 
However , air entrapment in HPDC parts has serious effects upon the casting quality . 
In order to reduce the air entrapment defects in a AlSi10 MnMg alloy thin-wall longitudinal load-bearing beam produced by HPDC , different gating systems were designed and simulated by software Flow-3D to evaluate the entrapped air . 
Simulation results showed that when the beam is produced by the original designed gating system with a middle ingate , there exist obvious air entrapments in the critical area； the volume of air entrapment was reduced by replacing the middle ingate to an overflow well , and the filling of molten metal became more stable . 
When the middle ingate was removed for further improvement , the volume of air entrapment was decreased drastically . 
The parts with glossy surface and good microstructure have been successfully produced by using the final optimized gating system based on simulation results.Abstract Fatigue Strength of Fibre-Reinforced Squeeze Cast Piston Alloy GP-AlSi 12 CuMgNi Under Elevated Temperatures On specimens made of squeeze-cast piston alloy GP-AlSi 12 CuMgNi without reinforcement and Al 2 O 3 -fibre-reinforced , thermal fatigue was investigated . 
Several mechanical properties such as tensile and compressive yield strength , incremental-step-method based monotonic and cyclic stress-strain curves in the temperature range of 20 to 400°C were determined . 
Moreover , fatigue tests in the range of 5 · 10 4 and 2.5 · 10 7 were carried out for various stress ratios in the same temperature range on unnotched specimens and S-N-curves were designed . 
Haigh-diagramms show the mean stress sensitivity of the materials . 
Obviously the fibre reinforced material is superiour at all regarded temperatures . 
The considerable gain of material strength obtained by fibrereinforcement entails even better conditions for the use of newly developed pistons under increased thermal load.The precipitation of primary intermetallic compounds from melts is often encountered in the aluminium casting industry , so that the formation , growth and sedimentation of intermetallics is usually viewed as having only a harmful influence on casting quality and production . 
However , such precipitation may remove both oxide films and harmful primary intermetallics from aluminium melts . 
Precipitation , therefore , may provide a new approach to purify liquid metals . 
However , little has been known about the precipitation of primary intermetallics in liquid aluminium-silcon alloy containing Fe , Mn and Ti . 
This research has investigated the mechanism of precipitation of primary intermetallic compounds in liquid Al 11.5Si 0.4Mg alloy . 
Precipitation was carried out at 600 degreesC for 10 minutes with two alloys ; a base alloy with no added titanium ( 0.01 % Ti on analysis ) and an alloy with 0.17 % Ti . 
The precipitating particles were examined and analysed using scanning electron microscopy . 
For the base alloy , only one precipitating particle , the primary iron-rich phase Al-15 ( FeMn ) ( 3 ) Si-2 , was found . 
For the higher level of Ti , in addition to the iron-rich phase , TiAl3 and Ti ( AlSi ) ( 2 ) were separately formed . 
The iron-rich phase was generally polyhedral or star-like in form ( occasionally , a dendritic morphology of the primary iron-rich phase was also found ) whereas TiAl3 formed as thick plates , and Ti ( AlSi ) ( 2 ) as thin platelets . 
The primary intermetallic compounds appeared to precipitate onto the wetted sides of the double oxide films.Many five-fold branched Si particles ( Si p ) were observed in Al-40 wt % Si functionally graded materials produced by a single-step laser cladding process on cast Al-alloy substrate . 
The fivefold twinning and growth features of Si p are scrutinized with orientation imaging microscopy and electron microscopic examination . 
It is a more in depth study of formation of the Si particles in functionally graded materials as published in our previous paper [ Pei , Y.T , and De Hosson , J.Th.M. , Acta mater. , 2000 , 48 , 2617 ] . 
These Si particles have grown from twinned decahedron nuclei consisting of five tetrahedrons that share a common 110 axis . 
The twin plane re-entrant edge ( TPRE ) mechanism explains both the branch growth in the radial direction and the elongation of Si p along their common 110 axis . 
Subsequent twinning within the twinned tetrahedrons provides additional re-entrant grooves on their top faces , which are important for the rapid elongation and consequently for the continuous growth of the branched particle . 
The 7.5deg mismatch that arises by putting together five tetrahedrons around a common 110 axis is accommodated by small-angle grain boundaries ( SAGBs ) . 
The SAGBs may disturb the progress of growth steps , which causes the particles to branch . 
The most remarkable facts of the study are that the five-fold branched silicon particles are much bigger ( 25~40 mum ) than the nanometer sizes previously reported in the literature and the 7.5deg mismatch is accommodated mainly by multiple SAGBs . 
The examples of a single SAGB reported before are just a special case of the SAGB mechanismThis paper reviews spin-transfer magnetization switching in ordered alloy-based nanopillar devices . 
L1-ordered FePt was used for one of the earliest demonstrations of spin-transfer switching in perpendicularly magnetized systems . 
The behaviour of magnetization switching deviates from the predictions based on a macro-spin model , suggesting incoherent magnetization switching in the system with a large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy . 
The effect of a 90° spin injector on spin-transfer switching was also examined using L1-ordered FePt . 
Full-Heusler alloys are in another fascinating material class for spin-transfer switching because of their high-spin polarization of conduction electrons and possible small magnetization damping . 
A B2-ordered CoFeAlSi-based device showed a low intrinsic critical current density of 9.3 × 10A cmfor spin-transfer switching as well as a relatively large current-perpendicular-to-plane giant-magnetoresistance ( CPP-GMR ) up to ~9 % . 
The specific physical properties of ordered alloys may be useful for fundamental studies and applications in spin-transfer switching.The corrosion behaviour of the AlSi1MgMn laser-shock-processed aluminium alloy was investigated in 3.5 % NaCl water solution at ph7 and 23°C . 
Potentiodynamic polarization tests were conducted at a scanning rate of 10mV/s , starting at 2000mV SCE . 
Corrosion plots showed pitting corrosion attack . 
The effect of heat treatment on the microstructure and superconducting properties of the eutectic alloy Al-11.3 at % Si prepared by the splat quenching technique has been studied . 
The anomalous magnetoresistivity in superconducting-normal transitions has been found and low temperature heat capacity was measured . 
Our results reveal the existence of two superconducting phases in this sample.The apparent activation energy for the dissolution of spherical silicon particles in an aluminium matrix is analysed using a numerical dissolution model in which local equilibrium at the particle-matrix interface is assumed . 
The model takes into account long range diffusion , the temperature dependent solid solubility of silicon in aluminium , the shape of the particle , the finite cell size in which the particle can dissolve and the statistical distribution of the particle size . 
It is shown that the apparent activation energy can deviate substantially from the activation energy for diffusion , which is the rate controlling process . 
The model is validated using isoconfigurational annealing experiments at various temperatures for a high purity Al-1.35 mass % Si alloy . 
An excellent agreement between theory and experiments is obtained . 
With minor modifications the model can be adjusted to predict the apparent activation energy of ( spherical ) particle dissolution in other binary systems tooThe aluminum cast alloys undergo surface treatments involving micro-electrochemistry for improved hardness , wear and/or corrosion resistance . 
The susceptibility to local galvanic coupling for three different permanent mold cast aluminum alloys , i.e . 
99.8 wt. % Al , Al–10 wt. % Si and Al–10 wt. % Si–3 wt. % Cu was investigated using the scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy ( SKPFM ) technique . 
All the particles detected in the alloys ( i.e . 
Al–Fe , Al–Fe–Si , Si , Al2Cu ) revealed a positive Volta potential difference relative to the matrix . 
However , the nobility depended on particles composition . 
The highest Volta potential differences were determined in the Al–10 wt. % Si–3 wt. % Cu alloy between the copper containing intermetallics and the aluminum matrix whereas the lowest differences were detected for the Al–Fe particles in the 99.80 wt. % Al specimen . 
Further , the matrix of the 99.8 wt. % Al specimen showed Volta potential differences possibly due to compositional gradients following casting.An Al 95Cr 3.1Fe 1.1Ti 0.8 ( in at. % ) alloy was made into rapidly solidified powder by melt atomization . 
The powder was compacted by two processes : 1 ) uni-axial cold compression at an ultra-high pressure of 6 GPa and 2 ) hot extrusion at 480 degC . 
The structures , mechanical properties and thermal stability of both materials were compared with the commercial AlSi 12Cu 1Mg 1Ni 1 ( in wt. % ) casting alloy , which is generally considered to be thermally stable . 
It was found that cold compression at ultra-high pressure created a compact and porosity-free material , which was similar to the material that was prepared with the commonly used hot extrusion method . 
The Vickers hardness , compressive strength and compressive yield strength of the cold-compressed alloy were 161 HV , 680 MPa and 547 MPa , respectively , which were higher than the values obtained for the hot-extruded and casting alloys . 
The thermal stability of the hot-extruded Al 95Cr 3.1Fe 1.1Ti 0.8 alloy was excellent because its mechanical properties did not change significantly , even after 100 h of annealing at 500 degC . 
The mechanical properties and thermal stability of the investigated materials were discussed in relation to their structures and diffusivities of the alloying elements.The work is a continuation of research concerning the influence of intensive cooling of permanent mold in order to increase the casting efficiency of aluminium alloys using the multipoint water mist cooling system . 
The paper presents results of investigation of crystallization process and microstructure of synthetic hypereutectic alloys : AlSi15 and AlSi19 . 
Casts were made in permanent mold cooled with water mist stream . 
The study was conducted for unmodified silumins on the research station allowing the cooling of the special permanent probe using a program of computer control . 
Furthermore the study used a thermal imaging camera to analyze the solidification process of hypereutectic silumins . 
The study demonstrated that the use of mold cooled with water mist stream allows in wide range the formation of the microstructure of hypereutectic silumins . 
It leads to higher homogeneity of microstructure and refinement of crystallizing phases and also it increases subsequently the mechanical properties of casting.The microstructure formation of AlSi alloys is known to be sensitive to specific solidification conditions . 
In particular , small fractions of heavier alloying atoms can lead to the precipitation of intermetallic phases . 
Moreover , the mainly dendritic structure is also sensitive to fluid flow in the melt . 
These two factors and their mutual influence is examined in this paper . 
The solidification of AlSi7 and AlSi7Mn1 samples was studied while inducing fluid flow by a traveling magnetic field ( TMF ) of approximately 5 mT strength , traveling up or down the sample axis . 
All samples were molten and directionally solidified at constant solidification velocities between 0.03 and 0.24 mm/s . 
The application of two separate heaters allowed the fixation of constant temperature gradients in the solid and liquid parts of the samples , the use of a transparent silica aerogel crucible permitted optical verification of the solidification velocity . 
Cross sections were cut from the processed samples and the microstructure analyzed using light microscopy and SEM-EDX . 
From these images , values for the primary , secondary and tertiary dendrite arm spacing were retrieved . 
Results are presented which show a clear effect of the TMF-induced fluid flow on the binary samples , but almost none for the ternary alloy . 
Finally , an explanation proposing a process of precipitate particle pushing is given.The wetting dynamics of silicon carbide forming AlSi alloys on carbon substrates is studied by the dispensed drop technique in high vacuum by varying the parameters : alloy composition , temperature and type of carbon ( vitreous carbon , pyrocarbon and pyrographite ) . 
The results on wetting are analysed in relation to those on interfacial reactivity and compared with model predictions.In this study , a computational mechanics approach has been developed to evaluate fracture toughness of an Al–Si cast alloy . 
Within the framework of the finite element method ( FEM ) CT-test experiments have been simulated on macro- and micro-scale levels with application of a cohesive zone model . 
Experimental CT tests have been performed and the parameters necessary for the FEM simulations ( fracture energy and cohesive strength ) have been determined . 
The estimation of fracture toughness from FEM simulations has been proposed based on a combination of crack propagation simulations on two-length scales in one run . 
The proposed approach enables one to understand the effect of pores of different sizes and locations on the fracture toughness of an Al–Si cast alloy.The electrochemical behaviour of the cut-edge of hot-dipped aluminium-silicon-based alloy coated steel is studied in immersed conditions in sulphate and in chloride media . 
Preliminary studies performed on steel-pure Al bi-electrode demonstrate that a significant galvanic current can develop at short times ( t < 1000 s ) only in chloride solutions . 
In situ measurements of current density and pH distributions over cut-edge coated steels immersed in chloride solutions revealed a quasi-steady state current between the coating and the steel substrate , resulting from local ( pitting like ) dissolution of the aluminium-silicon-based alloy coating . 
In sulphate solutions , the coating is not at all sacrificial and remains passive.Purpose : This work is focused on the abrasion resistance comparison of alloy and cermet based coatings with nitrided stainless steel.Design/methodology/approach : The coatings deposited on the steel substrates were subjected to the abrasion test according to a modified ASTM G-65 ( Rubber Wheel/Dry Sand Abrasion Test ) . 
Al2O3 abrasive sand with the granularity of 212-250 µm was used as an abrasive . 
Hybrid welding is , as regards selection of welding parameters , a tolerant process . 
On the other hand , the weld seam and the heat affected zone may tend to be wider as in an arc process , which may be detrimental to mechanical stability . 
With CO { sub } 2 laser beam butt welds as a basis for comparison , properties of butt welds of a peak-aged airframe alloy AA6013-T6/3.2 mm , produced by Nd : YAG-MIG hybrid , are investigated . 
A filler wire ( AA4047 ; AlSi12 ) was used for both types of welding . 
It is found that the hybrid process coarsened the microstructure in the fusion zone partly . 
Furthermore , although the weld seam and the heat-affected zone were wider , mechanical properties were not at all adversely affected . 
Changes in hardness and tensile strength were marginal and the fatigue performance was in fact improved for the hybrid welds . 
These results are presented and discussed . 
It is concluded that the hybrid welding deserves consideration for fatigue critical applications.This study thoroughly investigated the microstructure and mechanical properties of AlSi10Mg periodic cellular lattice structures with a wide range of volume fractions ( 5-20 % ) and unit cell sizes ( 3-7 mm ) fabricated via direct metal laser sintering ( DMLS ) . 
It was found that the arc-shaped melt pools are overlapping with each other and comprising near fully dense struts ( relative densities > = 99 % ) of the as-built lattice structures . 
The melt pools of the struts are characterized with very fine cellular-dendritic microstructure . 
Two distinctive zones in the melt pool can be distinguished : the boundary of melt pool possesses the coarse cellular/dendritic microstructure with the cell size or dendrite arm spacing ranging of 2-4 mu m , while the interior of melt pool exhibits the much finer cellular microstructure consisting of the 400-700 nm cells mainly filled with the alpha-Al matrix and some embedded rod-type Si-phases , and the network boundaries predominantly generated by the aggregates of approximately 20 nm Si particles . 
Both compression strength and microhardness decrease with the increase in the unit cell size when the volume fraction is fixed . 
This is mainly because the thinner struts of the smaller unit cell size lattice structures were cooled faster by their surroundings and then exhibit a higher cooling rate , leading to finer microstructure . 
The compression strength increases with increasing the volume fraction , and an equation based on the Gibson-Ashby model is established to estimate the compression strength of DMLS-produced AlSi10Mg gyroid cellular lattice structures with the 3 mm unit cell size . 
( C ) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.The heterogeneous nucleation of the solidification of Si by Al has been studied in melt-spun Al-3wt. % Si alloys , using a combination of differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . 
Melt-spun alloy samples have been heated in the DSC apparatus to above the AlSi eutectic temperature of 577 °C , followed by cooling , to monitor the solidification exotherms of Si-rich liquid droplets embedded in a solid Al matrix . 
The kinetics of the heterogeneous nucleation of the solidification of Si by the surrounding matrix are difficult to analyse , because of compositional variations during cooling . 
Alloys made with 99.9999 % pure Al have a microstructure of eutectic droplets which contain a fine cluster of Si particles embedded in an Al matrix . 
The eutectic droplets nucleate at about 517 °C , i.e . 
60 K below the eutectic temperature . 
The effect of the cooling rate on the shape of the solidification exotherms has been analysed to give a contact angle of 43° at the AlSi-liquid triple point.The effect of heat treatment on gas porosity and mechanical properties was investigated in a step test part manufactured by vacuum assisted high pressure die casting using a new AlSi10MnMg ( Fe ) secondary alloy . 
Porosity and mechanical properties were investigated in the T6 temper with different solution heat treatments . 
Porosity was characterized by metallographic and fractographic analysis of the tensile specimens . 
Mechanical properties comparable to the corresponding primary alloy have been achieved for each solution heat treatment . 
It was found that increasing the solution temperature and time increased the yield and ultimate tensile strength , while elongation decreased and porosity observed on the metallographic sections and fracture surfaces increased . 
Porosity evaluation on the fracture surfaces indicates that the local area fraction rather than the one observed on the whole fracture surface determines ductility . 
The size of the largest pore appears to become more relevant above values of 200µm.The microstructures and mechanical properties of high temperature and short exposing time tensilesamples of cast AlSi6Cu2Mg alloy are analyzed by TEM and SEM . 
With appropriate content alloyimg ele-ments , the mechanical properties of the alloy at room temperature , meanwhile , the high temperaturestrength can be improved due to retardation of accumulation and growth of Mg2Si phase.The effects of solution temperature and time on the evolution of microstructures and mechanical properties of squeezing casting ZAlSi12CuMgNi aluminium alloy were analyzed by metallography microscopy , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and microhardness tests.The results show that the intermetallic phases dissolve and the Si phases are fine , spheroidized and disperse gradually.The fine Si phases congregate , coarsen and grow when the solution time is too long.The coarsening velocity of Si phases will rise , and the time of intermetallic phases dissolved and Si phases spheroidized will be shorter with the increase of solution temperature , in addition , the degrees of dispersal and spheroidization of Si phases become greater.The mechanical properties of α ( Al ) solid solution show different formats with the solution prolonging at different solution temperatures.The best solution treatment is solution-treated at 525 530 ℃ for 2.5 3 h.The effects of processing parameters of semi-solid billets preparation , reheating temperature and holding time on the semi-solid slurry microstructure of AlSi7MgBe alloy by liquidus semi-continuous casting were studied.And the thixoforming feasibility of semi-solid AISi7MgBe alloy was investigated by analyzing the microstructure and properties of formed parts . 
The results showed that the microstructure is mainly the homogeneously fine rosette-shaped grains.The microstructure of the billets reheated at 595℃and held for 15 min are near-spherical grains suitable for semi-solid thixoforming.The semi-solid thixoformed parts of AlSi7MgBe alloy are clean-cut , compact and able to fulfill themselves through thixoforming which improves the microstructure and properties.Compared with the liquid forged castings , the hardness of SSM ( semi-solid metal ) forged castings is increased by 20 % . 
With the advantages of low cost , portability and compliance with ROM disc , write once disk has become the most popular storage media for computer and audio/video application . 
In addition , write once media , like CD-R and DVD-/+ R , are used to store permanent or nonalterable information , such as financial data transitions , legal documentation , and medical data . 
Several write once recording materials , such as TeO [ 1 ] , TeOPd [ 2 ] and Si/Cu [ 3 ] have been proposed to realize inorganic write once media . 
Moreover , we propose AlSi alloy [ 4 ] to be used for recording layer of write once media . 
It had good recording properties in DVD system although the reflectivity is too low to be used for DVD-R disk . 
In this paper , we report the further results in blue laser system , such as the static and dynamic characteristics of write once media.Thin films of CrN/AlSiN were deposited on SKD 11 tool steel and Si wafer substrates using Cr and AlSi alloy ( 0 at. % Si , 12 at. % Si , 15 at. % Si and 18 at. % Si ) cathodes in a nitrogen gas flow in a cathodic arc plasma deposition system . 
The effect of Si addition on the microstructure , mechanical and tribological properties of the films was investigated . 
The CrN/AlSiN thin films had a multilayered structure by rotating the substrate in which nano-crystalline CrN layers alternated with amorphous AlSiN layers , while CrN/AlN thin film contained nano-crystalline CrN layers alternated with hcp type AlN layers . 
The CrN/AlN thin film exhibited low hardness and low wear resistance . 
As the Si content in the amorphous AlSiN layers increased , the hardness and wear resistance of CrN/AlSiN thin films increased . 
The films deposited using Al0.82Si0.18 alloy cathode showed a maximum hardness of 47 GPa and excellent wear resistance , in which a low coefficient of friction of 0.28 and low wear rate of 6.67 × 10∿ # xA0 ; 7 mm3/Nm were presented . 
We also presented the simulation of amorphous AlSiN models with different Si contents . 
The simulation revealed that the Young 's modulus , yield stress and flow stress increased with the increase of Si content in amorphous AlSiN models.•Effects of different RE addition on a hypoeutectic as cast AlSi alloy are studied.•EDX , XRD , and DTA analyses of AlSi-RE samples are carried out.•Decrease in eutectic temperature is similar for all AlSi-RE samples.•Decrease in Vickers hardness is similar for all AlSi-RE samples.•RE addition increases corrosion resistance in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution.The development of high damping materials for noise reduction and attenuation of vibration on structural applications , such as automotive and aerospace industries , has been investigated . 
This experimental study is concerned with the damping capacity ( tan delta ) and dynamic Young 's modulus ( |E * | ) of Silicon carbide ( SiC ) reinforced aluminium ( Al ) matrix composite . 
AlSi-SiCp composite was produced by hot pressing technique . 
Damping capacity and dynamic Young 's modulus of composite and unreinforced AlSi alloy were studied using a dynamic mechanical analyser ( DMA ) , over a temperature range of room temperature-400 °C ( during heating and cooling phases ) , at 1 and 20 Hz . 
AlSi-SiC p composite showed higher damping capacity and dynamic Young 's modulus than the AlSi unreinforced alloy . 
Furthermore , damping capacity was found to increase with temperature , while modulus decreases . 
The possible damping mechanisms are presented and discussed.An experimental investigation of two potential candidate materials for the diamond die attachment is presented in this framework . 
These efforts are motivated by the need of developing a power electronic packaging for the diamond chip . 
The performance of the designed packaging relies particularly on the specific choice of the solder alloys for the die/substrate junction . 
To implement a high temperature junction , AuGe and AlSi eutectic alloys were chosen as die attachment and characterized experimentally . 
The choice of the AlSi alloy is motivated by its high melting temperature T-m ( 577 degrees C ) , its practical elaboration process and the restrictions of hazardous substances ( RoHS ) inter alia . 
The AuGe eutectic solder alloy has a melting temperature ( 356 degrees C ) and it is investigated here for comparison purposes with AlSi . 
The paper presents experimental results such as SEM observations of failure facies which are obtained from mechanical shear as well as cyclic nano-indentation results for the mechanical hardening/softening evaluation under cyclic loading paths . 
( C ) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.In this paper , the improvement of casting properties of the high-strength AlZnMgCu alloys is described . 
This improvement was achieved hy additions of Ni , Mg , and Si , which formed eutectic phases , thus reducing the crystallization interval of the alloy . 
The comparison of the castability and hot-tearing tendency was made for three alloys : nearly single-phase AlZn 6Mg 2 alloy , quasi-ternary eutectic AlZn 7Mg 7Cu 1Ni 3Si 3 alloy , and common casting AlSi 10 alloy . 
It was shown that the castability and hot-tearing tendency of the quasi-ternary eutectic alloy are similar to those of the AlSi alloyFour modified aluminide coatings were prepared on superalloy DZ38 G , which include a two step co-cementation coating Ni Cr-Cr Al and three one step co-cementation coatings Co-Al , AlSi and Al-Ti . 
Then their microstructure and hot corrosion behavior in a salt melt of 25 % Na Cl ( mass fraction ) +75 % Na2SO4 ( mass fraction ) at 900 ℃ were investigated . 
The results show that a continuously compact scale of corrosion products with good adhesion to the matrix could form on Ti- Al coating during corrosion , therefore , the Al- Ti coating may provide much better protectiveness to the alloy rather than the other three coatings in this kind of salt mixture.Micro-arc oxidation ( MAO ) coatings with different thickness ( 10 μm , 15 μm and 20 μm ) were deposited on LD10 Al alloy samples using MAO processing . 
The samples were tested using a rotating bending fatigue tester to character their fatigue properties . 
Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) was used to observe the microstructure and fatigue fracture morphology of the specimen with MAO coatings . 
X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) was employed to analyze the phases and residual stress in the coatings . 
The results show that the MAO coating is mainly composed of AlSi0.5O2.5 amorphous phase , and the net micro-cracks observed in the coating initiate in the discharge channel and end at the region near the discharge channel . 
The tensile residual stress presented at the interface of the substrate and the coating induces early crack initiation and propagation . 
Compared to the sample without MAO coating , the reduction of fatigue life are 63 % , 75 % and 65 % , and the reduction of fatigue limit are 9.5 % , 7.9 % and 9.9 % for the samples with the MAO coatings thickness of 10μm , 15μm and 20μm , respectively.The addition of a high percentage of silicon and a small percentage of magnesium to aluminum are the main enhancers largely used to improve the mechanical characteristics . 
Our goal , here , is to make a direct contribution to the mechanical properties in traction , the hardness , the resilience and the structural properties of the AlSi13 alloy used in sand molding and shell metal molding , mechanical as well as manual . 
The reference state is designated by crude casting , noted : F. To increase the characteristics and obtain substantially large yield stresses and higher stiffnesses , the material of numerical designation 44100 is subjected to the specific heat treatments , quenching and annealing . 
This study aims to determine the influence of the chemical composition , the structural hardening of sand casting and metal shell casting by gravity on the evolution of the tensile behavior , hardness , resilience and microstructure of the binary alloy 44100.Highlights Use the Bridgman solidification to fabricate the FeCoNiAl0.2Si0.2 high-entropy alloy . 
The coarse column-like grains can be obtained by directional solidification . 
The coercivity of this FeCoNiAl0.2Si0.2 alloy is largely reduced after directional solidification . 
After directional solidification , the FeCoNiAl0.2Si0.2 alloy & nbsp ; possesses magnetic anisotropy . 
Abstract The non-equiatomic FeCoNiAlSi alloy is prepared by the Bridgman solidification ( BS ) technique at different withdrawal velocities ( V & nbsp ; = & nbsp ; 30 , 100 , and 200 & nbsp ; μm/s ) . 
Various characterization techniques have been used to study the microstructure and crystal orientation . 
The morphological evolutions accompanying the crystal growth of the alloy prepared at different withdrawal velocities are nearly the same , from equiaxed grains to columnar crystals . 
The transition of coercivity is closely related to the local microstructure , while the saturation magnetization changes little at different sites . 
The coercivity can be significantly reduced from the equiaxed grain area to the columnar crystal area when the applied magnetic field direction is parallel to the crystal growth direction , no matter what is the withdrawal velocity . 
In addition , the alloy possesses magnetic anisotropy when the applied magnetic field is in different directions . 
Laser solid forming ( LSF ) has gradually become an important way to manufacture large-scale high-performance complex aluminum alloy components . 
AlSi10Mg alloy was deposited on the as-cast substrate by LSF using CO2 and YAG lasers respectively . 
The effects of laser type on the microstructure and mechanical properties of AlSi10Mg alloy deposits in as-deposited and T6 heat treated states were investigated . 
XRD , OM and SEM were used to study the microstructures of these deposits , and tensile test was performed to measure their mechanical properties . 
Results show that the as-deposited microstructure of AlSi10Mg alloy mainly consists of the columnar α-Al dendrites epitaxially grown with the orientation along the deposition direction and Al-Si eutectic in the inter-dendritic with the fiber or particle shape . 
Compared with the as-cast microstructure , these microstructure are refined remarkably , and the spheroidization of eutectic Si can be achieved only 3-5 min in solution treatment at 530℃ , which is also much shorter than that for the as-cast microstructure . 
Compared with CO2 laser , the more refined microstructure are obtained in LSF using YAG laser with the shorter wevelength . 
After T6 treatment , the mechanical properties of AlSi10Mg alloy prepared by YAG laser are obviously better than those of die-cast aluminum alloy.The interaction between modification with Sr and grain refinement with B was investigated to ensure a very fine grained matrix and a very fine fibrous eutectic in the AlSi7Mg alloy . 
The grain refinement offered by B is remarkable . 
B ( 200 ppm ) refines the grain structure of the AlSi7Mg alloy at least 10 times in a wide range of cooling rates between 0.1 and 10 K s -1 , whether added before or after Sr . 
While a weak grain refiner , Sr turns the coarse Si plates and needles into fine fibres . 
However , the modification capacity of Sr is impaired when there is B in the melt , possibly due to the formation of SrB 6 compound . 
The poisoning in the chemical modification of the eutectic phase in grain refined Al-Si alloys can be circumvented by quench modification . 
It takes cooling rates in the order of 10 K s -1 to adequately modify the eutectic phase in the Sr free grain refined AlSi7Mg alloy . 
Si fibres are still the predominant feature at lower cooling rates ( 1-10 K s -1 ) when modification of the eutectic phase relies not only on rapid solidification but also on Sr. Coarse Si plates and needles form only at very low cooling rates , well below 1 K s -1 . 
It is fair to claim that 200 ppm B may suffice for a sound structure in casting processes , which involve rapid solidification and thin sections , while Sr is needed for an acceptable modification of the eutectic phase when solidification is relatively slower.In situ neutron diffraction experiments were carried out during compression tests for Al-Si alloys with and without eutectic silicon with different architectures and reinforced with 20 vol. % of ceramic short fibres . 
The load partition between the aluminium matrix , the eutectic silicon and the short fibres was determined . 
The AlSi12 alloy in the as-cast condition and reinforced with ceramic short fibres , for which the eutectic silicon has the largest aspect ratio and forms bridges connecting the short fibres , presents the highest mechanical strength . 
The experimental results were rationalized using a mean field approach for which fibre fragmentation was taken into account .

Ultrasonic nano-crystal surface modification ( UNSM ) is an innovative surface processing technique that utilizes low amplitude ultrasonic frequency vibrations superimposed on a static load to generate plastic deformation on a metal surface to its improve properties and performance . 
In this study , we investigate the effect of UNSM on the surface finish of 3D-printed metals . 
An aluminum AlSi10Mg alloy fabricated by direct metal laser sintering ( DMLS ) was used as an example . 
It has been demonstrated that UNSM can significantly improve surface finish of 3D-printed aluminum alloy . 
For example , the surface roughness of the AlSi10Mg alloy was decreased from 18 to 3.5μm . 
With a better surface finish , UNSM is expected to improve the properties and performance of 3D-printed metals.Aluminium metal matrix composites are among the recent developments in engineering applications to meet the present day need of light weight , high strength/weight ratio and good wear properties . 
In the present study , AlSi10Mg alloy reinforced with 3 , 6 and 9 wt- % alumina with constant 3 wt- % graphite particles was produced by stir casting technique . 
Microstructural investigations as well as evaluation of mechanical properties such as hardness , tensile strength and double shear strength were conducted on composites and unreinforced alloy specimens . 
Tribological behaviour of hybrid composites was studied using pin on disc test machine . 
Wornout surfaces were analysed using scanning electron microscopy , and wear debris were analysed using X-ray diffraction . 
Results revealed that the mechanical properties of hybrid composites were higher than unreinforced alloy . 
Dry sliding wear test results indicated that the aluminium alloy reinforced with 9 wt- % alumina and 3 wt- % graphite has highest wear resistance compared to unreinforced alloy.The flow behaviour of an AlSi10Mg alloy melt in Saffil chopped fibre preforms during liquid metal infiltration aided by squeeze pressure or vacuum has been visualized . 
Experimental results indicate that under the external pressure the flow behaviour of the melt in non-wetting chopped fibre preforms is dominated by capillary laws and the geometrical characteristics of the interspaces between fibres . 
During the infiltration , the melt preferentially penetrated into the large interspaces in the preform in a manner analogous to flow in a capillary tube network . 
The degree of saturation of the interspaces is dominated by local infiltration pressure , and variation of the saturation degree at a given infiltration depth is determined by fibre distribution uniformity at the microscopic levelThe researches have concerned cavitation erosion of AlSi7Mg and AlSi11Mg aluminium casting alloys . 
The alloys have been investigated in the as-cast condition and after the precipitation hardening . 
The cavitation erosion tests were performed using vibratory cavitation erosion equipment in 5 minutes . 
Resistance to cavitation of tested materials was estimated by means of MDE ( mean depth of erosion ) parameter according to ASTM G32 . 
After the cavitation tests eroded surface of the specimens has been observed by means of scanning electron microscopy . 
The roughness of the surface was measured on profile contact tester . 
The best resistance for cavitation erosion exhibited AlSi7Mg alloy after heat treatment , the weakest AlSi11Mg alloy in as-cast condition.Fibre-matrix interfaces were investigated in alumina-short-fibre-reinforced aluminium alloys . 
The composites were produced by squeeze casting using pre-forms made of delta-alumina fibres ( Saffil ) or of alumosilicate fibres . 
Mostly the common piston alloy AlSi12CuMgNi was used as the matrix alloy , but some investigations were also performed on composites with a matrix of technically pure aluminium and the eutectic AlSi12 alloy . 
The piston alloy was used without any modification , with a strontium modification and with a lithium addition respectively . 
The composites were heat treated at 500degC for up to 60 days to study the thermal and chemical stabilities of the interface . 
The interfaces were investigated mainly by analytical transmission electron microscopy . 
The results are discussed with respect to wetting , adhesion and fibre-matrix reactionsHigh quality aluminium matrix syntactic foams ( AMSFs ) were produced by pressure infiltration . 
This method can ensure the maximal volume fraction of the reinforcing hollow spheres and very low amount of unwanted or matrix porosities . 
By this method hybrid MMSFs with mixed metal and ceramic hollow spheres were also produced . 
The matrix material was AlSi12 alloy and two different types – produced by Hollomet GmbH in Germany – of hollow spheres were used : Globomet ( GM ) and Globocer ( GC ) . 
The geometrical properties of the hollow spheres were similar ( average outer diameter ) , but their base material was pure iron and Al < sub > 2 < /sub > O < sub > 3 < /sub > +SiO < sub > 2 < /sub > in the case of GM and GC hollow spheres respectively . 
The volume fraction of the reinforcing hollow spheres were maintained at ~65 vol % , but the ratio of them was altered in 20 % steps ( 100 % GM + 0 % GC , 80 % GM + 20 % GC ... ) . 
The results of the compression tests showed , that the compressive strength , yield strength , plateau strength , structural stiffness and the absorbed mechanical energy values increased with higher ceramic hollow sphere reinforcement ratio . 
The fracture strains of the investigated MMSFs decreased with the higher GC ratio . 
Generally the strength values also increased with higher diameter to height ( H/D ) ratio from H/D=1 to H/D=1.5 and 2.Dry sliding wear properties of aluminum nitride ( AlN ) reinforced aluminum silicon ( AlSi ) alloy were investigated by using a pin-on-disc configuration tester . 
In this work , different weight percentages ( 5 and 10 wt % ) of AlN was added into the Al-Si alloys . 
The samples were prepared by a stir casting process via a bottom pour technique which was then aged with a T6 condition prior to the wear test . 
Detailed analyses on the morphologies were conducted using scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) with the aid of an energy dispersive x-ray analyser ( EDX ) . 
Prior to the heat treatment , the distribution of hard aluminum nitride particles that surrounded the Si phase had improved the hardness of the composites by 15 % . 
The hardness value was found to be significantly increased about 80 % for aged samples compared to un-aged samples . 
This was mainly contributed from precipitations of Si grain and intermetallic compounds ; Mg 2Si and FeSiAl 5 formation in the alloys . 
Thus , a significant increased in wear resistance up to 56 % was also observed especially at the highest applied load of 70N . 
Surface investigation by a scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) revealed that a combination of abrasion and adhesion wear mechanism was dominant for both unaged and aged samples.The changes of the three dimensional architecture of a eutectic AlSi12 alloy during heat treatment are revealed by means of synchrotron holotomography . 
The non-destructive nature of the holotomography technique allows to analyze the same volumes in different thermal conditions . 
The results show a disintegration of the interconnected eutectic Si-lamellae into isolated elongated particles . 
The load carrying capacity of both types of Si morphologies is studied by in situ neutron diffraction during compression tests . 
The experimental results are compared to those obtained using a micromechanical model developed for metal matrix composites based on a homogenization approach . 
The correlation between experiments and calculations shows that the interconnectivity of Si must be considered to account for the strength exhibited by the eutectic alloy . 
The present study bridges the gap between the already available two-dimensional studies of architecture and properties of the binary AlSi12 alloy and new three-dimensional studies of more complex systems based on this alloy.Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) is an Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) technique that built 3D part in a layer-by-layer method by melting the top surface layer of a powder bed with a high intensity laser according to sliced 3D CAD data . 
AlSi10Mg alloy is a traditional cast alloy that is broadly used for die-casting process and used in automotive industry due its good mechanical properties . 
Many researches have been conducted on the topic of the AlSi10Mg alloy , covering different aspects of the selective laser melting fabrication process . 
However , a database is still lacking much information and understanding regarding the properties of the material under different conditions , which will allow a tailoring of suitable properties to the required application . 
This work aims to provide a correlation between the mechanical properties of vertically built ( Z samples ) AlSi10Mg specimens subjected to different post-processing conditions and the change in properties in relation to these conditions and the fracture mechanism . 
Among these is the accepted T5 stress relief treatment , a modified T5 treatment , the as-built condition and a high temperature Hot Isostatic Pressing treatment . 
A more in-depth analysis of the fracture mode for the vertical build direction is provided with emphasis on the mechanism for each treatment as well as a quantitative analysis of the Full Width at Half Maximum via X-Ray diffraction measurements . 
The modified T5 treatment suggested was found to result in an increase in strength values beyond those of the as-built condition and a 64 % increase in yield stress compared to the typical T5 treatment with a concurrent decrease in elongation values . 
It is suggested that at 200ºC nano-scale precipitation of Silicon particles occurs , responsible for the strength elevation . 
Charpy impact test results are provided for each condition and their fracture mode is compared to the tensile tests and discussed.Several binary and ternary alloys from the Al-Ti-B system were tested for their capacities to grain refine aluminium foundry alloys . 
The growth restriction factor estimations evidence that the Al-3Ti alloy contributes to the grain refinement of AlSi7Mg0.3 alloy via only growth restriction , providing a twofold reduction in grain size . 
There is a marked improvement in the grain refining efficiency when Al-Ti-B ternary alloys are employed . 
While the efficiency increases with increasing B concentration , the mild improvement over a wide range of grain refiner compositions implies that the AlSi7Mg0.3 alloy is not very sensitive to the composition of the ternary Al-Ti-B grain refiners . 
Al-3B alloy provides the smallest grains at an addition rate of 200 ppm B , producing an average grain size of 298+or-36 mum in the commercial AlSi7Mg0.3 alloy . 
The grain refinement efficiency is doubled when the Al-3B grain refiner was added to the Ti free counterpart with average grain size of 145+or-10 mum.In recent years , additive manufacturing has gained importance , especially since the full melting of the raw material in the selective laser melting process enables the fabrication of directly deployable components . 
However , the multiple directional dependencies involved result in an anisotropic material behavior . 
The raw material under investigation in this study was the precipitation-hardenable AlSi10Mg alloy , with the main focus on the positioning and inclination effects , which were studied on six characteristic orientations . 
In addition , the superimposed effects based on the surface condition and thermal post-treatments were taken into account . 
The examination contained : comprehensive tensile tests with strain gauges , detecting strains in two directions ; detailed surface hardness investigations in various conditions ; and micro-section investigations . 
Major direction dependencies were revealed and the tensile strength and the surface hardness results , coupled with annealing procedures , exhibited consistent results , explaining the encountered findings . 
The Young ’ s modulus varied between 62.5 GPa to 72.9 GPa with the Poisson ’ s ratio fluctuating between 0.29 and 0.36 . 
Regarding the tensile strength , the UTS ranged from 314 MPa to 399 MPa with breaking elongations spanning from 3.2 % to 6.5 % in the non-heat-treated condition.A feasibility study of laser clad 7 wt. % yttria partially stabilized zirconia ceramic coatings undoped or doped with 2.5 wt. % TiO 2 to produce single tracks and partially overlapped tracks on the surfaces of AlSi9Cu3 , AlZn10Si8Mg and AlSi10Mg alloys was carried out by using a 6 kW RS5000 continuous wave CO 2 laser together with continuous powder-feeding system . 
The dependencies of the macro and microquality of ZrO 2 ceramic coatings on the properties of the coating powder and laser parameters , and microstructure ( such as morphology , phase transformation , etc . ) 
were studied . 
The addition of 2.5 wt. % TiO 2 into the YPSZ powder is beneficial for the controllable cracking in the ceramic layer on AlSi9Cu3 alloy . 
The ceramic layers on three kinds of aluminum alloys exhibit planar ZrO 2 crystals with different sizes at the lower , columnar grains in the intermediate , and equiaxed grains at the upper region of the cross-sections . 
Small amounts of molten aluminum alloy are observed to segregate at the boundary regions of columnar or equiaxed grains in the ZrO 2 layer because of the poor affinity . 
The ceramic layers consist mainly of nontransformable t ' phase and small amount of the retained c phase . 
Under conditions of optimum laser parameters and coating powder properties , the bonding to aluminum alloys is satisfactory with small dilution . 
Molten aluminum alloy is also observed to flow into the cracked ZrO 2 layer at the bottom to seal these cracks . 
The hardness of the ZrO 2 ceramic layer was 1415-1575 HV0.1 , which is mainly attributed to the absence of porosity and fine grains in the ceramic layersSelective laser melting ( SLM ) is widely gaining popularity as an alternative manufacturing technique for complex and customized parts . 
SLM is a near net shape process with minimal post processing machining required dependent upon final application . 
The fact that SLM produces little waste and enables more optimal designs also raises opportunities for environmental advantages . 
The use of aluminium ( Al ) alloys in SLM is still quite limited due to difficulties in processing that result in parts with high degrees of porosity . 
However , Al alloys are favoured in many high-end applications for their exceptional strength and stiffness to weight ratio meaning that they are extensively used in the automotive and aerospace industries . 
This study investigates the windows of parameters required to produce high density parts from AlSi10Mg alloy using selective laser melting . 
A compromise between the different parameters and scan strategies was achieved and used to produce parts achieving a density of 99.8 % .This paper analyzes various significant process parameters of the die casting method of AlSi 9Cu 13 aluminum alloy . 
An attempt has been made to obtain optimal settings of the die casting parameters , in order to yield the optimum casting density of the AlSi 9Cu 13 aluminum alloy castings . 
The process parameters considered were : piston velocity ( first and second stage ) , metal temperature , filling time and hydraulic pressure . 
The effects of the selected process parameters on the casting density and the subsequent optimal settings of the parameters have been accomplished using Taguchi 's method . 
The results indicate that the selected parameters significantly affect the density of AlSi 9Cu 13 aluminum alloy castings Highlights Composites reinforced by CNTs and SiCp were produced by hot-pressing technique . 
The hardness of the hybrid composite was higher as compared to the composites . 
The AlSi alloy reinforced by CNTs and SiCp showed superior wear behaviour . 
The same mechanisms acting at different scales ( nano/micro ) are effective . 
Abstract The aim of this paper was to examine the wear behaviour of a hybrid AlSi–2wt % CNTs–5wt % SiCp composite . 
For comparison purposes the unreinforced AlSi alloy , AlSi–2 % wtCNTs and AlSi–5wt % SiCp composites were used . 
A powder metallurgy processing route was used to produce the unreinforced AlSi alloy and AlSi composites . 
Dry reciprocating pin-on-plate wear tests were performed and the results showed that the wear behaviour was improved for all produced composites when compared to the unreinforced AlSi alloy . 
However the best wear behaviour was achieved in the case of AlSi hybrid composite . 
This improvement is attributed to the combine effects of both constituent reinforcements . 
The dominant wear mechanisms were characterized by scanning electron microscopy with X-Ray Energy Dispersive Spectrometry analysis.The effects of sludge intermetallic particles on the mechanical properties of a secondary AlSi9Cu3 ( Fe ) die-casting alloy have been studied . 
Different alloys have been produced by systematically varying the Fe , Mn , and Cr contents within the composition tolerance limits of the standard EN AC-46000 alloy . 
The microstructure shows primary alpha-Al-x ( Fe , Mn , Cr ) ( y ) Si-z sludge particles , with polyhedral and star-like morphologies , although the presence of primary beta-Al5FeSi phase is also observed at the highest Fe : Mn ratio . 
The volume fraction of primary compounds increases as the Fe , Mn , and Cr contents increase and this can be accurately predicts from the Sludge Factor by a linear relationship . 
The sludge amount seems to not influence the size and the content of porosity in the die-cast material . 
Furthermore , the sludge factor is not a reliable parameter to describe the mechanical properties of the die-cast AlSi9Cu3 ( Fe ) alloy , because this value does not consider the mutual interaction between the elements . 
In the analyzed range of composition , the design of experiment methodology and the analysis of variance have been used in order to develop a semi-empirical model that accurately predicts the mechanical properties of the die-cast AlSi9Cu3 ( Fe ) alloys as function of Fe , Mn , and Cr concentrations .

Heat treatment of laser fused aluminium surfaces In the presented paper laser fused aluminium surface layers are studied . 
Substrat is a hypereutectic AlSi 20-alloy ; additives are powder mixtures of B 4 C and Ni in different weight rates . 
The specimens are heat treated at 300°C and 540°C . 
The influence of filler mixture and heat treatment are investigated on hardness and friction behavior . 
It is aimed on finding a filler mixture thats leads to a surface layer with an optimum combination of hardness , friction behavior and thermal stability.This work investigates the effects of various Al alloys ( including Al , AlMg1SiCu , and AlSi10Mg ) , mixed with 15wt % Fe 2O 3 , on the selective laser melting ( SLM ) facilitated in situ reaction and formation of Al metal matrix composite ( MMC ) components . 
The results contribute to the development of medium/high strength Al composite parts which can be produced as complex net-shape products via the SLM process . 
Visual observation and computed tomography ( CT ) scanning reveal the best SLM consolidation performance and the lowest porosity for AlSi10Mg . 
SLM facilitated in situ reaction and subsequent rapid solidification introduce very fine particles ( down to ~50-100nm ) , reinforcing the microstructure of all Al ( alloy ) composites . 
The particles are Al-Fe intermetallics , Al oxides such as alpha-Al 2O 3 , plus Si crystals ( alone or in combination ) depending on the alloy composition . 
Ultrafine/nanoscale dendritic feature appears in the reinforced matrix of AlSi10Mg/15wt % Fe 2O 3 , in contrast with featureless matrix of Al/15wt % Fe 2O 3 . 
The in situ particle reinforced Al ( alloy ) composites are significantly harder than corresponding conventionally manufactured ( e.g . 
casting ) Al alloys without Fe 2O 3 , due to superior microstructural characteristics such as featureless or very fine dendritic matrix , ultrafine/nanoscale particles , and also enhanced solid solubility of the SLM products .

This study is aimed at presenting the possibility of recycling chromium contained in ashes from leather shaving incineration ( ALSO and indicating its utility as raw material for the production of commercial high carbon ferrochrome alloy ( HC-FeCr ) . 
Initially , a thermodynamic analysis was carried out for simulating the process of chromium oxide reduction to provide the basis and the most favorable conditions for the experiments . 
At the laboratory level , experiments were performed to demonstrate the feasibility of using chromium bearing ashes for the production of HC-FeCr alloy . 
The results demonstrated the possibility of producing HC-FeCr alloy from the ALSI by carbothermal reduction at a temperature of 1600 degrees C. ( C ) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.An analysis of the literature concerning the methods of surface treatment of aluminum alloys has been performed . 
Based on the literature and on earlier initial investigation ( hardness measurements , microscopic inspection , roughness measurements , tribological tests and scanning microscope inspection of AlSi6Cu4 and 6082 ( PA4 ) alloy samples exposed to laser , it has been determined that the hardness of the AlSi6Cu4 alloy has increased from the level of 60 & # x2013 ; 80 HV 0.1 to the level of 120 & # xa0 ; HV 0.5 due to laser treatment , while heat treatment dispersion hardening has resulted in further increase of the hardness of the laser treated zones up to the level of 160 HV . 
The even structure obtained allows us to propose such technology for increasing hardness and wear resistance of those alloys . 
In the 6082 alloy , containing less alloy elements , the hardness increase is smaller reaching the level of 120 HV 0.5 . 
This is related to obtaining zones with dispersion secretions . 
The suggested laser treatment parameters , 400 W and 530 W with the traverse velocity of 2.8 to 5.33 mm/s do not cause significant increase of roughness , due to which such surface does not require further machining . 
The results of initial tribological investigation are very promising and they allow us to expect that the technology of structure comminution by laser treatment will allow for improving the life time of products with laser treated surface.This paper reports experimental investigations of the effect of machining parameters ( discharge current , pulse-on time , pulse-off time , voltage ) on the machining feed rate and surface roughness during wire electrical discharge machining ( WEDM ) of metal matrix composite AlSi7Mg/SiC and AlSi7Mg/Al 2O 3 . 
Generally , the machining characteristics of WEDM metal matrix composites are similar to those which occur in the base material ( AlSi7Mg aluminium alloy ) . 
The machining feed rate of WEDM cutting composites significantly depends on the kind of reinforcement . 
The maximum cutting speed of AlSi7Mg/SiC and AlSi7Mg/Al 2O 3 composites are approximately 3 times and 6.5 times lower than the cutting speed of aluminium alloy , respectively.The influence of Sr , Mg and Cu content on the microstructure of a high-pressure die cast AlSi9Cu3 ( Fe ) alloy is reported . 
Metallographic and image analysis techniques have been used to quantitatively examine the microstructural changes occurring at different Sr , Mg and Cu levels . 
The results reveal that the Sr and Cu increase the amount of microporosity in the die castings , while Mg counteracts this effect . 
The secondary dendrite arm spacing and the grain size slightly decrease by the addition of the alloying elements . 
Compared with the base AlSi9Cu3 ( Fe ) alloy , the Sr-modified alloy shows significant refinement and morphological modification of eutectic Si particles in the central regions of the castings . 
In contrast , such mechanisms at the casting surfaces are substantially driven by more rapid solidification . 
The Mg and Cu addition annihilates the benefits of refinement of eutectic Si particles by Sr modification , while it seems to not affect their morphology . 
The combined addition of Cu and Mg determines an increase of Cu- and Mg-rich intermetallic compounds , while the Sr-modified alloy shows lower fraction of intermetallics , even if comparable to the base alloy in terms of other alloying elements .

In this article , the results of investigations of abrasive wear resistance and wear under the fretting of the samples obtained by the method of laser microcladding have been presented . 
The material for sample preparation was powder of Al–Si hypereutectic alloy with the following composition : 70–74 wt % Al and 26–30 wt % Si .

Highlights Thermoelastic martensitic transformation was found in the Co2Cr ( AlSi ) alloys . 
The parent and martensite phases have L21 and L10 structures , respectively . 
The parent phase was determined to be in ferromagnetic state . 
The martensite phase was confirmed to have weakly magnetic state . 
Over 2 % of superelasticity was obtained for the polycrystalline sample by compression test . 
Abstract Martensitic transformation behaviors and magnetic properties in off-stoichiometric Co2Cr ( AlSi ) Heusler alloys were investigated mainly by TEM , DSC , SQUID and mechanical test . 
In Co57Cr21Al11Si11 alloy , martensitic transformation from Heusler-type L21 to D022 phase was confirmed , where Ms and Af temperatures were 429 and 452 & nbsp ; K , respectively , suggesting thermoelastic martensitic transformation because of the small transformation temperature hysteresis . 
In polycrystalline Co57Cr25Al10Si10 alloy with large grains , superelasticity with a recovery strain of over 2 % was detected by compression test at 298 & nbsp ; K. Thus , a novel Co-based shape memory alloy was discovered in the Co–Cr–Al–Si system. < p > The use of aluminium and magnesium alloys offers a great potential for weight reduction in automotive applications . 
Load‐bearing car components are subjected to 10 < sup > 8 < /sup > cycles and more during service , and the high‐cycle fatigue properties of construction materials are therefore of great interest. < /p > < p > The time‐saving ultrasound fatigue testing method has been used to study the fatigue properties of a high‐pressure , die‐cast magnesium alloy AZ91 hp and a post‐forged , cast‐aluminium alloy AlSi7Mg0.3 in ambient air and saltwater ( 5wt % sodium chloride ) spray . 
In ambient air , fatigue cracks in AZ91 hp emanate from voids , and it is possible to correlate void areas with the numbers of cycles‐to‐failure . 
Post‐forging of AlSi7Mg0.3 reduces the numbers and size of voids . 
The remaining small voids ( void areas smaller than 9000 μm < sup > 2 < /sup > ) do not significantly reduce lifetimes . 
Saltwater deteriorates the fatigue properties of both the lightweight alloys . 
With increasing numbers of cycles , the influence of the corrosive liquid on fatigue strength becomes more pronounced. < /p > In this paper , different hypo-eutectic Al–Si cast alloys with varying silicon , copper and iron contents were tested under thermo-mechanical fatigue ( TMF ) conditions to achieve a unified approach to damaging and fatigue endurance behaviour . 
The cylinder heads from which the specimens were taken were serially produced with T79 heat treatment . 
This includes homogenisation , quenching and ageing . 
The alloy used by these investigations are commonly used for automotive cylinder heads . 
Under operational conditions , a complex interaction of mechanical and thermal cyclic loadings is inherent . 
Hence , the main purpose here is to distinguish between the influences of the alloying elements of hypo-eutectic Al–Si cast alloys and propose its effects to mechanical and environmental damages . 
The results underlined the important role of hard phases for crack nucleation especially in high copper alloys . 
The hard phases , like eutectic silicon or primary AlCu , AlFeSi phases in general got ruptured , independent of the applied mechanical loading . 
In contrast , damages in low copper alloys were caused by high plastic matrix deformations and the loss of adhesion of eutectic silicon particles . 
For both types of alloys , the crack propagation was mostly constrained on the eutectic itself . 
An improved TMF endurance was achieved by AlSi9Cu1 ( Sr ) and primary AlSi8Cu3 . 
Here , probably the increased matrix strength by precipitation hardening and the manifold crack deflections on the eutectic silicon reduced intrinsically the microstructural damage . 
Further , in TMF regimes it is recommended to use Al–Si cast alloys with low iron contents because present ternaryα-Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2and quaternaryβ-Al5FeSisupported crack nucleation and lowered the fatigue endurance . 
Additionally , an over-aged AlSi7MgCu alloy in T74 condition significantly lacks in fatigue endurance because of a minor fatigue strength by incoherentθ-precipitations . 
However , the results presented here identify the major damages of hypo-eutectic Al–Si cast alloys and the influences of the alloying elements on TMF endurance . 
This enables further unified fatigue modelling by the automotive designer and additional optimizations of the metallurgical systems by the foundry which underlines the demand of improved knowledge of the cylinder head under real-life operational conditions.Light weight nano/submicrocrystalline materials are promising group of constructional materials combining low density with high mechanical properties . 
However , their potential application requires extensive testing of functional properties , e.g . 
tribological ones , which may be significant and determine their practical use . 
Available information on abrasive wear and friction coefficients in nano/submicrocrystalline materials is rather poor . 
Therefore the aim of this paper is to fill the gap in the literature in this field . 
The AlSil2Fe5Cu3Mg alloy ( RS422 ) produced by rapid solidification and plastic consolidation with grain size of basic phase components in the range from 50 nm to 300 nm was examined . 
Microstructure and mechanical properties of the materials were determined . 
Abrasive wear tests , static and kinematics friction coefficients measurement were carried out under the surface condition including dry , wet and oil lubricant . 
The results have been compared to the values of similar quantities determined in the same conditions for conventionally produced alloy AlSi11FeCuMn ( AK11 ) . 
Substantial increase of friction coefficients for RS442 comparing to AlSi11FeCuMn material was found , however , abrasive wear for nano/submicron grained materials were low in comparison to conventional one . 
Considerable increase of abrasive wear at water presence and very weak attrition at oil lubrication was observed . 
Relationship between structure and mechanical properties of tested materials was analyzed.To obtain the billet with homogeneous and spheroidized primary grains is the key step in the semi-solid forming process . 
Among the semi-solid billet preparation methods , the process of low-superheat direct chill ( DC ) casting is simpler and more effective . 
In this study , the billets of AlSi7Mg alloy were prepared by low-superheat DC casting at various withdrawal rates . 
The effect of withdrawal rate on the surface quality of the billets was investigated , and the evolution mechanism of the microstructural morphology in the billets was analyzed . 
The results show that the periodic corrugations and a large quantity of fine shrinkage pits appear in the billet surface when the withdrawal rate is 100 mm·min-1 , and the above defects in the billet surface can be eliminated completely when the withdrawal rate is above 150 mm·min-1 . 
But when the withdrawal rate is too fast ( 250 mm·min-1 ) , the primary α grains , except the ones in the billet center , have not enough time for ripening due to the high silidification rate , and will solidify as the dendrite structure . 
When the withdrawal rate is between 150 - 200 mm·min-1 , the dendritic growth of the primary α grains is effectively inhibited , and a billet of AlSi7Mg alloy with a smooth surface and homogeneous , fine , non-dendritic grains can be obtained.Light alloys like aluminum and its alloys have excellent physical and mechanical properties for a number of applications . 
The use of aluminum alloys can significantly decrease the mass of automobiles without decreasing structural strength . 
Therefore , the reason of this work was to determine the optimal cooling rate values , to achieve good mechanical properties for protection of this aluminum cast alloy from losing their work stability , and to make it more resistant to action in hard working conditions . 
The carried out investigations have allow to found that changes in the cooling rate do not cause changes in the phase composition , revealing the Al2Cu and Al5FeSi phase especially , but only changes the morphology of α & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; β eutectic as well as the particle size and secondary dendrite arm spacing . 
As a result , the number of fine crystals in per unit volume increases , leading to a fine grain structure , which influences the recalescence temperature . 
The purpose of this research work is to investigate the thermo-derivative interdependencies occurred in analyzed aluminum cast alloys using Universal Metallurgical Simulator and Analyzer . 
For the investigation , the cast AlSi9Cu aluminum alloy was used . 
As a result of this research , the cooling rate influence on the structure and mechanical properties changes was investigated . 
The cooling rate was set in a variable range of 0.16–1.25 & nbsp ; °C & nbsp ; s−1 , where the cooling rate of 0.16 & nbsp ; °C & nbsp ; s−1 corresponds to freely cooling , without any forced air flow.An innovative approach for pre-dispersing MgO nanoparticles with AlSi alloy nanoparticles was established , and the nanoparticles were dispersed well in carbon structural steel . 
After adding different mass fractions of MgO nanoparticles in steel , the majority of inclusions contained MgO·Al2O3 spinel and MgO-Al2O3-bearing hybrid inclusion , and these inclusions promoted acicular ferrite ( AF ) formation . 
With increasing amount of added nanoparticles , the average inclusion size increased from 0.90 to 1.50 μm and the inclusion size was considerably refined , but the ability of inclusions to induce AF was greatly declined . 
It was revealed that the inclusion size was the decisive factor influencing the inducing ability of inclusions for AF , which also got a solid support from the nucleation thermomechanical and dynamic analyses . 
When the mass fraction of MgO nanoparticles reached 0.05 pct , the proportion of AF in microstructure is relatively larger and the degree of interlocking of the AF within the microstructure was optimized . 
The ferrite grains also got refined and the average grain size decreased by more than 94 pct compared with that of the original steel.AlSi10Mg alloy has been widely used in selective laser melting ( SLM ) . 
However , the formation of metallurgical defects in this material during SLM process has not been studied sufficiently . 
In this work , different laser parameters were adopted to fabricate the specimens . 
The effects of volumetric energy density ( VED ) on the metallurgical defect , densification , phase composition and mechanical property were also comprehensively analyzed . 
At low VED of 37.39 J/mm < sup > 3 < /sup > , a nearly full dense sample with density of 2.602 g/cm < sup > 3 < /sup > can be printed . 
The sample with maximal tensile strength of 475 MPa can be printed . 
While with the increase of VED , the ultimate tensile strength decreases due to the formation of micro-pores . 
The formation mechanisms of micro-pores including gas pores and keyhole-induced pores were disclosed from the angle of alloy smelting . 
Better understanding of the influence mechanisms of the laser parameters on the formation of metallurgical defects is beneficial for the production of high performance SLM parts .

Abstract PVD coatings , based on nano-diamond ( ND ) and molybdenum disulfide nano-layers are tested and the results are presented in this paper . 
The best coating is built of 40 repeated functional blocks , where each block contains four alternating 10 & nbsp ; nm thick layers consisting of Cr & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; 5 % ND , Cr , Cr & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; MoS2 and Cr . 
It was determined from friction tests that the optimal total thickness is 40 blocks . 
The AlSi9Cu3 ( Fe ) aluminum alloy was used as the testing material . 
The HS6-5 steel twist drills of 6.0 & nbsp ; mm in diameter were used , with and without protective coatings , at the cutting speed of 75.3 & nbsp ; m/min and the feed rate of 0.06 & nbsp ; mm/rev . 
Large burrs were formed when uncoated drills were used . 
In the case of using coated drills the vast majority of holes did not show any burrs or the sizes of the burrs were considerably smaller . 
The number of holes with burrs increased slightly with the drilling time . 
The built-up edges were formed along the major cutting edges of the drill . 
The intensity of built-up formation varied and depended on the drills used : the uncoated drills have built-up edges to a significantly greater height than the drills with the coating . 
Pickups are formed at the area of the drill chisel edge and at drill flutes and pickup sizes are more significant for the uncoated drills . 
The VB value of the flank surface wear for the uncoated drill was significantly higher as compared to the coated drill . 
The tool life of coated drill was found to be approximately 2.5 times longer in comparison with the uncoated drill . 
title : Effect of copper and iron on the wear properties of spray formed Al – 28Si alloy 
In the present study the effect of copper ( Cu ) and iron ( Fe ) on the wear behavior of spray formed Al – 28Si alloy has been investigated . 
The spray formed Al – 28Si alloy exhibited equiaxed grain morphology with ﬁ ne and uniform distribution of Si particles in Al matrix and spray formed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy exhibited similar morphology with small needles of β - Al4FeSi intermetallics and globular shaped θ - Al2Cu precipitates spread along the boundaries and junctions of grains . 
Hot pressing has considerably reduced the porosity in spray formed alloys . On the contrary the microstructure of as - cast Al – 28Si alloy consisted of coarse primary and eutectic Si unevenly distributed in Al matrix and that of as - cast Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy consisted of coarse Si particles , long needles of β - Al4FeSi2 and θ - Al2Cu phases in Al matrix . Spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy exhibited higher value of hardness compared to the other alloys . 
The wear behavior of these alloys under dry sliding conditions showed that the spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy exhibited maximum wear resistance and minimum coef ﬁ cient of friction , while as - cast Al – 28Si alloy showed minimum wear resistance and maximum coef ﬁ cient of friction over the entire range of loads . 
The high wear resistance of spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy is explained in light of its microstructural modi ﬁ cations induced during spray forming and the topography of worn surfaces . 
The chemical composition of Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys is shown in Table 1 . The details of spray forming set up employed in the present study have been described elsewhere [ 9 ] . In brief , spray forming process employed an annular convergent – divergent nozzle to create a spray of melt . 
In each run 2 . 5 kg of alloy has been melted to a temperature of 800 ° C in a resistance heating furnace . 
The molten metal is atomized by a free fall atomizer using nitrogen ( N2 ) gas . 
The resultant spray is deposited over a Cu substrate resulting in a near net shaped preform . 
The process variables employed for producing the preforms are listed in Table 2 . Specimens of size 100 × 30 × 20 mm were cut from the preforms . The specimens were hot pressed at a pressure of 55 MPa and a temperature of 480 ° C for densi ﬁ cation . 
The density of spray formed alloys was measured by using Archimedes principle as per ASTM : B962 - 08 . 
The percentage of porosity ( % P ) in the spray formed alloys was measured by using the actual density ( ρ ac ) and the theoretical density ( ρ th ) of the alloys using the relation , % P = [ 1 - ( ρ ac / ρ th ) ] × 100 . 
Samples were extracted from as - cast , as - spray formed and spray formed + hot pressed Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys for microstructural examination . 
The samples were prepared by polishing using standard metallographic techniques of grinding on emery paper with 1 / 0 , 2 / 0 , 3 / 0 and 4 / 0 speci ﬁ cations . 
Final polishing was done on a wheel cloth using brasso and kerosene . 
The polished samples were etched with Keller ’ s reagent ( 1 % vol . hydro ﬂ uoric acid ( HF ) , 1 . 5 % vol . hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) , 2 . 5 % vol . nitric acid ( HNO3 ) and rest water ) . 
The microstructures of samples were examined under a ZEISS Optical Microscope and Scanning Electron Microscopy ( Model : S - 3400N Hitachi Model ) . 
Wear tests were conducted on all the alloy specimens on a pinon - disk wear testing machine ( Model : TR - 20 , DUCOM ) as per ASTM : G99 - 05 . 
The counterpart disk was made of quenched and tempered EN - 32 steel having a surface hardness of 65HRC . 
Wear specimens of size Ø 8 × 30 mm were machined out from all the alloys . 
The specimens were polished and then cleaned with acetone before conducting the test . 
The wear tests were conducted by varying the load from 10 to 70 N at a sliding velocity of 1 . 5 m / s and a sliding distance of 1025 m . 
The worn surfaces of wear specimens were examined under Scanning Electron Microscopy . 
The hardness of the alloys was measured by Vickers Hardness Tester ( Mattoon ATK - 600 ) at an applied load of 300 g as per ASTM : E384 - 11e1 . 
Fig . 1a shows the microstructure of as - cast ( AC ) Al – 28Si alloy . 
It consists of primary and eutectic Si phases in the α - Al matrix . 
The primary Si particles exhibited a plate like morphology with a size varying from 75 to 350 μ m , while eutectic phase comprises of Si needles . Fig . 1b depicts the microstructure of as - spray formed ( SF ) Al – 28Si alloy . 
The microstructure consists of an equiaxed , nearly spheroidized grain morphology of α - Al matrix . 
The Si particles are very much re ﬁ ned having a size varying from 2 to 15 μ m , and are uniformly distributed in the Al – matrix . 
A porosity of 14 % was observed in the as - spray formed alloy . 
An equiaxed , homogeneous , and uniform distribution of primary Si phase and modi ﬁ ed eutectic phase in Al – matrix of as - spray formed alloy can be obtained due to abundant nucleation of the melt due to rapid cooling in the ﬂ ight and on deposition . 
The semi solid droplets are fractured due to inter particle collision in the spray during ﬂ ight and upon impinging on a substrate . 
Also due to remelting of the solid component of the spray in the top surface region of the deposit effectively break the Si particles that are formed prior to the deposition stage [ 10 , 11 ] . 
The presence of such Si phase leads to an increase in the density of nuclei in the top layer of the as - spray formed alloy [ 12 ] . The microstructure of spray formed and hot pressed alloy shown in Fig . 1c exhibited a ﬁ ner matrix , fragmentation of Si phase , lower porosity of 7 % and enhanced density of the alloy . The acicular eutectic structure in the as - cast alloy seems to be at variance with short and blunted structure in the corresponding as - spray formed alloy ( Fig . 1b ) . 
The optical microstructure of as - cast Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy is shown in Fig . 2 . 
A relatively slow cooling rate associated with casting process develops coarse microstructural features of the alloy . The microstructure consists of block like grey primary Si particles and ternary β - Al4FeSi2 intermetallic sharp edged white rod / needles having a length ranging from 150 to 250 μ m and θ - Al2Cu phase in Al matrix . 
The Energy Dispersive X - ray ( EDX ) spectra of various phases present in the microstructure as indicated by the points in Fig . 2 are shown in Fig . 3 . 
The various phases are α - Al ( point 1 ) , primary Si ( point 2 ) , θ - Al2Cu ( point 3 ) and β - Al4FeSi2 ( point 4 ) . 
The β - phase is naturally a hard and brittle precipitate with a needle form , which usually acts as a stress raiser and interferes with liquid ﬂ owing in the interdendritic channels during solidi ﬁ cation [ 13 ] . 
Cu was found to exist mainly in the interdendritic Al2Cu phase seen around the Al4FeSi2 phase as Chinese script . 
Fig . 4a shows the microstructure of as - spray formed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy . 
It consists of uniformly distributed spherical shaped Si particles having an estimated mean size of 10 μ m in the α - Al matrix . In addition , no banded microstructure was observed in this alloy . The spherical morphology and non - connected distribution of pores have been observed in the as - spray formed alloy . 
Approximately 15 % porosity was found which suggests that the formation of pores occurred due to the incorporation of included gas , a well described phenomenon caused by an excessive presence of liquid during the spray generation [ 14 ] . 
The EDX spectra of various phases present in the microstructure as indicated by the points in Fig . 4a are shown in Fig . 5 . 
The various phases are α - Al ( point 1 ) , θ - Al2Cu ( point 2 ) , β - Al4FeSi ( point 3 ) and primary Si ( point 4 ) . The primary Si particles are uniformly distributed in the a - Al matrix . 
The bright phase could be identi ﬁ ed as θ - Al2Cu precipitates with globular morphology around very small needle type intermetallics with β - Al4FeSi . After hot pressing , the alloy showed partially re - crystallized grains together with elongated grains and a strong reduction in porosity to 4 % ( Fig . 4b ) . 
The primary Si particles are further fragmented in to smaller particles and are distributed uniformly in the Al matrix . 
The results of hardness measurement are shown in Table 3 . 
It is observed that the hardness of the spray formed alloys are higher than that of as - cast alloys . 
Also the hardness of Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe spray formed alloys are higher than that of Al – 28Si spray formed alloys . 
The higher hardness of as - spray formed Al – 28Si alloy can be attributed to the microstructural re ﬁ nement in primary Si phase owing to the rapid solidi ﬁ cation effect . 
In case of as - spray formed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy , apart from the re ﬁ nement of primary Si , the re ﬁ nement of Al4FeSi and Al2Cu phases have imparted a higher hardness to the alloy . 
A further increase in the hardness was observed in the spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si alloy due to the partial recrystallization , fragmentation and redistribution of primary Si phase in α - Al matrix and reduced porosity . 
In spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy apart from the re ﬁ nement of primary Si and reduced porosity , the fragmentation and redistribution of secondary phases ( β - Al4FeSi and θ - Al2Cu ) further increased the hardness of the alloy . 
The microstructural changes from as - cast to spray formed and hot pressed alloys , could lower the stress concentration at the interface of the Al4FeSi particles and α - Al matrix . Therefore , the tendency to initiate the subsurface cracks is reduced resulting in a higher hardness [ 15 ] . 
The wear characteristics of Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys for a range of applied load at a sliding velocity of 1 . 5 m / s and a sliding distance of 1025 m are shown in Fig . 6a . 
The load is varied from 10 to 70 N . 
It is observed from the Fig . 6a that the wear rate is increasing with increase in the load for all the alloys irrespective of the alloy processing condition . 
In the entire range of applied load , among both the alloy compositions the spray formed + hot pressed ( SF + HP ) alloys showed better wear resistance than the as - cast alloys . 
Comparative study of wear behavior of binary and quaternary alloy compositions revealed that the spray formed + hot pressed ( SF + HP ) Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy has got better wear resistance than that of spray formed + hot pressed ( SF + HP ) Al – 28Si alloy under identical sliding conditions . 
The wear resistance is highest for spray formed + hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy and lowest for as - cast Al – 28Si alloy . 
Obviously the size of primary Si has a great in ﬂ uence on the wear rate of these alloys . 
During the wear tests , the coarse Si phases fractured more frequently than the ﬁ ne Si phase [ 16 ] . 
As the load increases , the shear stress in the alloy increases which in turn increases the amount of fracture in Si phase and the deformation of the matrix in the surrounding area of Si . The stress concentration resulting from such deformation may critically depend on the size of Si particles and will be more severe at the interface between coarse Si particles and the matrix compared to that between ﬁ ne Si particles and the matrix . 
This is observed in the present study where the coarse Si phases fractured readily thereby decreasing the wear resistance of the as - cast alloys . 
Spray forming has re ﬁ ned the primary and eutectic Si into ﬁ ne particulates which are distributed uniformly in the α - Al matrix . 
In case of as - spray formed alloys the wear rates are little higher than that observed in spray formed + hot pressed alloys . 
The reason may be due to the presence of pores in the former alloys . 
Among the alloy compositions , the wear resistance of Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys is higher than that of Al – 28Si alloys . 
The addition of alloying elements Cu and Fe to Al – 28Si has improved the wear resistance of Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys . 
The wear resistance of quaternary as - cast alloy is higher than that of binary as - cast alloy . 
This is because of the reason that the quaternary alloy consists of β - Al4FeSi2 and θ - Al2Cu phases . The β - phase is basically hard and increases the hardness of the alloy there by increasing the wear resistance [ 14 ] . 
The θ - phase provides strengthening effect to α - Al matrix that reduces the chances of peeling off of coarse Si plates from the matrix there by improving the wear resistance [ 15 ] . 
The wear resistance of spray formed and hot pressed quaternary alloy is higher than that of as - cast quaternary alloy . 
This is due to the re ﬁ nement of long needles of β - Al4FeSi2 phase and Chinese script like θ - Al2Cu phase in to ﬁ ne needles in the α - Al matrix . 
Also the plate like primary and needle like eutectic Si phases have been broken down to ﬁ ne particulates of Si that have been uniformly distributed in the α - Al matrix . 
Hot pressing of as - spray formed alloy has further fragmented the Si , β and θ phases into ﬁ ne particles there by increasing the wear resistance of the alloy . 
Fig . 6b depicts the friction plot of Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys . 
The coef ﬁ cient of friction is found to be more or less constant in all the alloys but the coef ﬁ cient of friction of spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy is the lowest and that of as - cast Al – 28Si alloy is the highest . 
The worn surfaces of Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys at a load of 70 N are shown in Fig . 7 . 
The worn surface of as - cast Al – 28Si alloy specimen shown in Fig . 7a clearly indicates the mark of an adhesive wear with plastic deformation . 
The gross plastic ﬂ ow of metal , metallic fracture of ridges , edge cracking and large dimples can be seen on the worn surface of the as - cast alloy . The block - like primary Si particles are more easily detached from matrix and the debris of Si particles is embedded in the matrix , resulting in deep and non - uniform grooves . 
Typical surface damage , abrasive scoring marks , deeper and wider craters are also clearly observable . 
As seen in Fig . 7c the worn surface of as - spray formed Al – 28Si alloy shows smooth appearance with small grooves due to plastic deformation on the surface and oxidation of asperities , indicating the existence of mixed metallic and abrasive wear . The low wear rate of the as - spray formed alloy compared to as - cast alloy is attributed to the microstructural re ﬁ nement and large amount of ﬁ ne and uniformly distributed Si particles in α - Al matrix . 
With increasing load , the fragmentation of Si particles and their ability to support the load results in the direct contact of matrix with the counter face and a large strain within the α - Al matrix adjacent to contact surfaces . 
This might lead to the subsurface crack growth and delamination . 
The broken ﬁ ne hard Si particles entrapped between the counter face and the alloy may act as third - body abraders that may be responsible for the ﬁ ne longitudinal grooves on the worn surface . 
The worn surface of spray formed + hot pressed Al – 28Si alloy shown in Fig . 7e reveals pronounced smooth sliding marks containing shallow grooves with smaller width ridges and few small dimples . 
The smaller width is due to the re ﬁ nement of the primary Si phase caused during hot pressing . 
For the material with higher hardness , abrasive wear tends to take place , while for material with lower hardness adhesive wear is encountered [ 17 ] . 
In the present study , for spray formed + hot pressed alloy with hardness value 116 , abrasive wear has been found to be the main mechanism , while for as - cast alloy with hardness value 67 , adhesive wear has taken place . 
Thus , it can be said that the wear mechanism may also depends on the hardness of the material . 
The worn surfaces of Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys are shown in Fig . 7b , d and f . 
The worn surfaces of all the alloys are less damaged compared to that of Al – 28Si alloys . 
The reason is due to addition of Fe and Cu alloying elements to Al – 28Si alloy . 
The β - phase is hard and increases the hardness of the alloy and θ - Al2Cu phase provides strengthening effect to Al matrix there by reducing the chances of peeling off of Si phase from the Al matrix . 
This again improves the wear resistance of the alloy . 
The surface damage observed in asspray formed alloy is lesser than that of as - cast alloy . 
This is due to the re ﬁ nement of Si , β - phase into ﬁ ne needles and θ - phase into ﬁ ne particles in the as - spray formed alloy . 
The surface damage observed in spray formed and hot pressed alloy is lesser than that observed in as - spray formed alloy . 
This is because of further fragmentation of Si , β and θ phases into ﬁ ner particles and reduction of porosity due to hot pressing . 
The as - cast alloy is characterized by deep scoring marks . 
This is less in as - spray formed alloy and still lesser in spray formed and hot pressed alloy . 
The following conclusions may be drawn from the present study on the spray forming and hot pressing of Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys : 
( 1 ) Spray forming is effective in re ﬁ ning the microstructures of Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys .

( 4 ) Addition of Cu and Fe increased the wear resistance of Al – 28Si alloy . 
The wear resistance is highest and the coef ﬁ cient of friction is lowest for spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy compared to as - spray formed and as - cast alloys .

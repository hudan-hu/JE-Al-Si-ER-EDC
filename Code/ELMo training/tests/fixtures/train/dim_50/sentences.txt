Title : TiC particulate - reinforced Al – 20Si – 5Fe composite fabricated by melt in situ reaction spray forming 
A novel technique in which TiC particulates are fabricated by an in situ reaction in molten aluminum is introduced for producing TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe composite . 
In order to reveal the characteristics of the technique , in this paper the formation mechanism of TiC particulates obtained by this method is studied . 
Both theoretical and experimental results have shown that the TiC particulates are formed by a diffusion mechanism when the molar fraction of aluminum in the preform is greater than 20 . 02 % . 
Contrarily , the TiC particulates are formed by a solutionprecipitation mechanism when the fraction is less than 20 . 02 % . 
An unwanted needle - like phase is always present in the spray - formed alloys . Experimental results have shown that the amount of the brittle phase decreases in spray - formed Al – 20Si – 5Fe preforms with increase in the TiC content , and that the brittle phase can be eliminated completely by adding more than 3 wt . % TiC particulates to the alloy . 
Moreover , another major problem of coarsened silicon particulates , often encountered in hyper - eutectic Al – Si alloy has also been solved by using the technique . 
Elemental Ti ( 360 mesh , 98 % ) , graphite ( 200 mesh , 99 % ) and Al ( 200 mesh , 98 % ) were mixed by dry milling with steel balls for 2 h according to ( 1 - X ) TiC + XAl ( X = 5 , 35 wt . % ) at a C – Ti molar ratio of 1 : 1 . 
Then , each powder mixture was pressed mechanically into a cylindrical preform of 20 mm diameter and 25 mm height . 
The preforms were inserted into molten aluminum alloy held at 900 ° C . 
When all of the reactions were completed ( the end point of the reaction can be determined by observing the evidence of a dazzling light originated from the reacted preform ) , the composites were prepared by spray forming . The melt was atomized using nitrogen gas at 0 . 8 MPa pressure . 
An atomizer – substrate distance of 390 mm , and a delivery tube diameter of 3 . 1 mm were used . 
Some preforms were taken out immediately after all of the reactions were completed in order to study the formation mechanism of the TiC particulates . 
The morphologies of the TiC particulates in the reacted preforms and in the TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe composites were observed using a Cambridge S360 scanning electron microscopy . 
The composite specimens were etched in a solution of mixed acids ( 2ccHF + 3ccHCl + 5ccHNO4 + 250ccH2O ) . 
The needle - like phase was examined using H800 transmission electron microscopy at 200 kV . 
The morphologies of TiC particulates in the reacted preforms with 5 . 0 wt . % Al and 35 wt . % Al , are shown in Fig . 1 . The TiC particulates in these preforms are generally spherical , but the size of most particulates in the preform with 5 . 0 wt . % Al is larger . 
Strictly speaking , the process in which TiC particulates are produced in molten aluminum alloy is a non - equilibrium process . 
However , it is difficult to study thermal diffusivity out of the preforms . 
Considering that there is not enough time to dissipate the heat generated when TiC is produced in molten aluminum alloy , the reaction Ti + C → TiC is complete , thus the Ti – C – Al system can be regarded approximately as an adiabatic system . 
The thermodynamic data of TiC and Al for the present calculations are listed in Table 1 [ 7 , 8 ] . 
For Al = 5 : 0 wt . % , we have γ ≈ 62 : 34 % from Eqs . ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . 
The calculated results shows that about 62 vol . % of the TiC produced in the preform is in the liquid state . 
In this case , the molten TiC will precipitate from the liquid state during the cooling process in quick succession and grow to be larger TiC particulates . The calculated result is confirmed by Fig . 1 ( a ) where most of TiC particulates exhibit a larger shape . 
The effect of the addition of aluminum as a diluent on the theoretical adiabatic temperature ( Tad ) and on the fraction of molten TiC is demonstrated in Fig . 2 . 
As can be seen from this figure , the fraction of molten TiC decreases with increase in the aluminum content in the preforms . 
When the aluminum content reaches and exceeds a critical value , no molten TiC can be formed in the reacted preform . 
For γ = 0 in Eq . ( 2 ) , the critical aluminum content can be achieved , i . e . x ≈ 20 : 02 % , i . e . the TiC particulates produced in the preforms could only be formed by a diffusion mechanism when the fraction of aluminum is greater than 20 . 02 % . 
Contrarily , there would certainly be some TiC particulates formed by a solution - precipitation mechanism in a higher temperature zone . 
In this work , 5 . 0 and 35 wt . % Al in the preform are selected . 
From Fig . 1 , one can easily find that most of the larger TiC particulates exist in the 5 . 0 wt . % Al preform , showing that these TiC particulates are formed by the solution - precipitation mechanism , while all of the TiC particulates in the 35 wt . % Al preform are formed by the diffusion mechanism . 
In this case , their size is finer . 
This shows that the experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical calculations mentioned previously . 
Hypereutectic Al – Si alloys are known to be suitable for use as piston materials . 
Iron is often added to aluminum alloys to enhance their heat resistance . 
However , an unwanted needle - like phase is always present in the spray - formed alloy ( Fig . 3 ) . 
TEM analysis of the alloy billet indicated that the needle - like phases are δ ( Al4FeSi2 ) and β ( Al5FeSi ) , depending on the cooling rate and the melt superheat ( Fig . 4 ) . 
The Al4FeSi2 is a metastable phase , while Al5FeSi phase is a stable phase . 
The reason for the formation of the Al5FeSi phase is associated with the thermal conditions of the impinging droplets , because the solidification process during spray forming occurs in two stages : gas atomization ( rapid cooling ) and droplet consolidation ( relatively slow cooling ) . 
In the case of lower melt temperature ( Fig . 4 ( b ) ) , the Al4FeSi2 phase is able to form within droplets to some extent before deposition . 
Upon droplet deposition , an abrupt fall in the solidification rate occurs on the deposit layer . 
At this time , the Al4FeSi2 phase originating from the droplets can be readily transformed into the stable Al5FeSi phase due to slow cooling effect and due to the fact that Al4FeSi2 phase is extremely metastable . 
This is further verified by the fact that a number of the Al4FeSi2 phases contain some over - spray powders . 
It is clear that the needle - like phases are very harmful for material properties because of their fragility , and so are a potential path for crack growth . 
It is very interesting that the amount of the brittle phase decreases with increasing TiC content and that the brittle phase can be eliminated successfully by adding 3 wt . % TiC particulates to the alloy ( Fig . 5 ) . 
The reason why the needle - like phase is precluded entirely in the final product is that the TiC particulates are formed in situ in the aluminum alloy matrix and can play a role in heterogeneous nucleation . 
This is beneficial to the elimination of the needle - like phase . 
Moreover , one can see that another primary problem of coarsened silicon particulates initially encountered in the hypereutectic Al – Si alloy has also been solved by using this technique ( see Figs . 3 and 5 ) . 
Both theoretical and experimental results have shown that diffusion , and solution - precipitation mechanisms occur during the formation process of the TiC particulates produced by this method . 
When the molar fraction of aluminum in the preform exceeds 20 . 02 % , TiC particulates are formed by the diffusion mechanism . In this case , their size is finer . 
Contrarily , there would certainly be some TiC particulates to be formed by the solution - precipitation mechanism when the fraction of aluminum in the preforms is less than 20 . 02 % . 
In this case , their size is larger . The unwanted needle - like phase has been eliminated successfully by the in situ addition of 3 wt . % TiC particulates to the alloy . 
Title : Effect of Fe and Mn additions on microstructure and mechanical properties of spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy . 
Spray deposition is a novel process which is used to manufacture rapidly solidified bulk and near - net - shape preforms . 
In this paper , Al – 20Si – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy was prepared by spray deposition technique . 
The effect of Fe and Mn additions on microstructure and mechanical properties of spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy was investigated . 
The results show that two kinds of intermetallics , i . e . δ - Al4FeSi2 and β - Al5FeSi , is formed in the microstructure of spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy . 
With additions of 5 % Fe and 3 % Mn to Al – 20Si – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy , the needle shape of Al – Si – Fe intermetallic phases is substituted by the particle shape of Al15 ( FeMn ) 3Si2 phases . 
The presence of the intermetallic phases ( δ - Al4FeSi2 , β - Al5FeSi and Al15 ( FeMn ) 3Si2 ) improves the tensile strengths of the alloy efficiently at both the room and elevated temperatures ( 300 ° C ) . 
In Table 1 are listed the chemical compositions of the alloys . 
The spray deposition experiments were conducted in an environmental chamber . 
During spray - deposition process , the molten metal was atomized by N 2 at 800 ° C , the distance of atomizing deposition was kept constant at 400 mm . 
The preform , after being cut into cylindrical billets was extruded at a temperature of 400 ° C with a reduction ratio of 10 : 1 and a ram speed of 5 mm / s . 
After extrusion , the materials were cooled in air . 
In this study , a commercially used scheme of heat treatment for the alloy was applied , which involved solution treating at 470 ° C for 1 . 5 h followed by water quenching , and artificial ageing at 120 ° C for 24 h . 
The microstructures of spray - deposited materials were characterized using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) attached with energy dispersive X - ray analyses ( EDX ) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and X - ray diffraction . 
A S360 type scanning electron microscopy working at 15 kV was used to observe the microstructures . 
The scanning electron microscopy samples were prepared using standard metallographic techniques and were etched using Keller ' s reagent . The transmission electron microscopy studies were conducted on a H - 800 type transmission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV . 
The X - ray diffraction experiments were performed on a Japan Rigaku diffractormeter using Cu - K α radiation . 
The room and elevated temperature tensile tests were conducted with an Instron tensile testing machine at an initial strain rate of 0 . 5 s − 1 . 
The elevated temperature tensile tests were conducted at 573 K at the same initial strain rate . 
Fig . 1 ( a ) shows the typical scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) microstructure of the spray - deposited A 0 alloy , which is composed of the aluminum matrix and the silicon phase mostly with a particle shape . 
The presence of eutectic Al – Si phase and coarse , block primary Si phase in the conventionally processed ingot metallurgy ( IM ) counterpart was suppressed . 
With the addition of 5 % Fe to the Al – 20Si – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy , a high volume fraction of needle - shaped intermetallic was formed after spray deposition , as can be seen in Fig . 1 ( b ) . 
The intermetallic phases with a platelet shape were determined to be the Al – Si – Fe compound by energy dispersive X - ray analyses ( EDX ) analysis . 
Fig . 1 ( c ) shows the scanning electron microscopy microstructure of the spray - deposited A 2 alloy . 
By comparing it with Fig . 1 ( b ) , it can be easily seen that the intermetallic phases with a platelet shape were suppressed , and a high volume fraction of particle - like compound was formed in the microstructure . 
EDX was used to check the composition of the intermetallic phases with a particle shape , it showed that the particle - like compound contains Al , Si , Fe and Mn . 
Fig . 2 shows the X - ray diffraction ( XRD ) patterns of the spray - deposited alloys . 
XRD was performed to identify second phases , and analysis of the diffraction patterns shows that the intermetallic phases mainly are δ - Al 4 FeSi 2 and β - Al 5 FeSi compounds in the A 1 alloy , and the particle - like compounds are Al 15 ( FeMn ) 3 Si 2 phases in the A 2 alloy . 
Fig . 3 ( a ) shows the transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) photograph of the intermetallic phases with a platelet shape in the microstructure of spray - deposited A 1 alloy . 
Energy dispersive X - ray analysis showed that the phase contains elements of Al , Si and Fe , and this phase being identified as δ - Al4FeSi2 compound with tetragonal parameters of a = 0 . 609 nm and c = 0 . 944 nm using electron diffraction , as can be 
seen in Fig . 3 ( b ) . 
Fig . 4 ( a ) shows the transmission electron microscopy photograph of another intermetallic phases with a platelet shape in the microstructure of spray - deposited A 1 alloy . 
Indexing of the selected area diffraction patterns indicates that the needle - like phases are β - Al 5 FeSi compounds with monoclinic parameters of a = b = 0 . 612 nm and c = 4 . 15 nm , as can be seen in Fig . 4 ( b ) . 
The transmission electron microscopy results are in good agreement with the X - ray diffraction ones , as shown in Fig . 2 . 
Fig . 5 ( a ) shows the transmission electron microscopy micrograph of spray - deposited A 2 alloy , it can be seen that some particles are distributed in the matrix of the microstructure , the resultant spectra from Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy ( EDS ) indicate the phase contains elements of Al , Si , Fe and Mn . 
Fig . 5 ( b ) shows a selected area diffraction pattern of the particle - like intermetallc that being identified as Al 15 ( FeMn ) 3 Si 2 . 
Spray - deposited alloys were subjected to tensile testing at room and elevated temperature after extrusionand heat treatment . 
Table 2 summarizes the tensile test results . 
It is worth noting that the tensile strengths of the A 1 and A 2 alloy for T6 condition are much higher than of the A 0 alloy at room temperature . 
Obviously , the intermetallics play an important role for the increasing of the tensile strength . 
From Table 2 , with additions of 5 % Fe to Al – 20Si – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy , both the yield and ultimate tensile strengths was increased 55 and 64 MPa at room temperature , respectively . 
The reason may be that a lot of dispersion - strengthened intermetallics , such as δ - Al 4 FeSi 2 and β - Al 5 FeSi , distributed in the matrix , they can prevent dislocation moving , and enhance strength of the alloy at room temperature . 
With addition of 3 % Mn to Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy , the variation of the tensile properties at room temperature was not remarkable . 
However , 3 % Mn addition leads to a substantial improvement of the tensile strengths at elevated temperature . 
This reflects the additional strengthening effects of fine particle dispersion and retained substructure contributed by the Al 15 ( FeMn ) 3 Si 2 particles , which serve as extra obstacles to dislocation gliding . 
The dispersion of the thermally stable Al 15 ( FeMn ) 3Si 2 particles , in combination with their inhibition to growth of the grains occurring at elevated temperature , is considered to be the key to the enhanced hot strength of the alloy . 
The microstructure of spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy is composed of the Al matrix and particulate - like Si phase . With addition of 5 % Fe to Al – 20Si – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy , two kinds of intermetallics , i . e . δ - Al 4 FeSi 2 and β - Al 5 FeSi , is formed in the microstructure . 
With additions of 5 % Fe and 3 % Mn to Al – 20Si – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy , the needle shape of Al – Si – Fe intermetallic phases is substituted by the particle shape of Al 15 ( FeMn ) 3 Si 2 phases . 
The tensile test results indicate that spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy has better strength than the Al – 20Si – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy at both the room and elevated temperature ( 573 K ) due to the presence of δ - Al 4 FeSi 2 and β - Al 5 FeSi intermetallics . 
The tensile properties of the spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Mn – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy are superior to the Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy at elevated temperature . 
Title : Microstructure and thermal expansion behavior of spray - deposited Al – 50Si 
The evolution of microstructure and coefficient of thermal expansion ( CTE ) of the Al – 50Si ( wt . % ) alloy manufactured by spray deposition followed by hot isostatic pressing ( HIP ) are systematically investigated . 
The results indicate that the microstructure of the deposited alloy is composed of primary Si with average size of 12 . 5 ± 0 . 1 l m and a - Al . 
The CTE of the deposited alloy is higher than the corresponding alloy produced by casting due to the high solid solubility of Al in Si . 
After HIP , the CTE is lower than the parent as - deposited alloy owing to the high solid solubility of Si in Al . 
The residual thermal stress results in a higher CTE during the second heating as a result of the CTE mismatch between the Al matrix and the primary Si particles . 
Furthermore , the measured CTE value is in good agreement with the Turner model after complete densification by HIP at 843 K . 
An alloy with nominal composition Al – 50Si ( wt . % was atomized by nitrogen gas at 1573 K and spray deposited on a cylindrical aluminum substrate . 
The distance between the atomizing nozzle and the substrate was kept constant at 500 mm during the deposited process . 
The atomization pressure was set at 1 . 5 MPa . 
After spray - deposition , the samples were hot isostatically pressed ( HIP ) for 3 h under Ar atmosphere at the temperatures 793 K and 843 K using a pressure of 120 MPa . 
For comparison , an Al – 50Si ingot was produced by conventional solidification using a 65 kW medium frequency induction furnace . 
Before pouring , the melt was degassed with high purity argon for 30 min at about 1573 ± 30 K using a rotary degasser . 
The permanent mold was preheated to 523 K before casting . 
The surface of the melt was skimmed and then the melt was poured into the copper mold , and finally quenched to room temperature . 
The microstructure of the alloy was investigated by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) using a Gemini 1530 microscope equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy ( EDS ) detector . 
The phases were characterized using a Rigaku D / max - RB X - ray diffractometer ( XRD ) with monochromatic Co K a radiation . 
Dilatometry measurements were carried out under argon atmosphere from room temperature to 773 K ( heating rate 5 K / min ) using a thermo - mechanical analysis equipment ( NETZSCH DIL 402C ) in accordance with the ASTM : E473 . 
The thermal expansion of the specimens during heating was measured using a linear position transducer in two consecutive cycles . 
The samples were first heated from 298 to 773 K , then cooled down and stabilized at 298 K , re - heated to 773 K , and finally cooled down to 298 K at a rate of 5 K / min . 
The bulk density of the alloys was measured using the Archimedes principle . 
Image analysis was used to calculate the mean size of the primary Si phase . 
In order to ensure reproducibility of the results , at least ten micrographs were used for the calculation . 
Fig . 1 shows the typical microstructures of the Al – 50Si alloy prepared by casting and spray deposition techniques . 
As illustrated in Fig . 1 ( a ) , the primary Si displays coarse platelet morphology with an average size of 221 . 4 ± 2 . 1 l m in the cast alloy . 
The eutectic Si exhibits plate - like and needle - like shapes , as shown in Fig . 1 ( b ) . 
The microstructure of the spray - deposited alloy consists of primary Si particles with an average size of 12 . 5 ± 0 . 1 l m and the Al matrix ; no Al – Si eutectic is found in the alloy , as shown in Fig . 1 ( c ) and ( d ) . 
During the cooling step of the atomization process , a large number of fine semi - solid primary Si particles emerge in the droplets before depositing on the substrate [ 3 ] . 
The droplets impinge the substrate with a high speed and , as a result , they are remelted due to the latent heat of crystallization of the surrounding areas . 
During this process , the large primary Si particles can undergo cracking and fracture . 
The fractured Si phase can therefore lead to the increase of the nucleation sites . 
In the following solidification step , which displays lower cooling rate , there is enough time for the Si atoms to diffuse towards the primary Si that formed previously [ 20 , 21 ] . 
Accordingly , no eutectic Al – Si is found in the spray - deposited Al – 50Si alloy . 
Fig . 2 displays the XRD patterns of the Al – 50Si alloys produced using different techniques . 
All diffraction peaks can be attributed to Al or Si and no additional phases can be observed . 
The peaks of the Si phase for the deposited alloy are shifted to low angles compared with the cast material ( compare Fig . 2 ( a ) and ( b ) ) , indicating that the lattice parameter of Si increases as a result of the increases solid solubility of Al [ 22 ] . 
Therefore , it can be inferred that a Si ( Al ) solid solution is formed in the alloy after spray deposited alloy . 
This hypothesis is corroborated by Fig . 3 , which shows the EDS results for the primary Si phase . 
It is found that the amount of Al in Si in the deposited alloy is 2 . 39 ± 0 . 24 at . % , which is significantly higher than the cast alloy ( 0 . 41 ± 0 . 12 at . % ) . 
This result is in good agreement with the XRD patterns . 
Fig . 4 shows the typical microstructures of the spray - deposited Al – 50Si alloy after HIP at different temperatures . 
The phase composition after HIP is the same as observed for the parent spray - deposited alloy . 
The average size of primary Si increase lightly from 12 . 5 ± 0 . 1 l m for spray - deposited material to 12 . 7 ± 0 . 1 l m and 13 . 2 ± 0 . 2 l m after HIP at 793 and 843 K , respectively . 
Fig . 2 ( c ) and ( d ) displays the XRD patterns of the spray - deposited Al – 50Si alloy after HIP . 
The a - Al phase shift to high angles with increasing the HIP temperature compared with the as - deposited alloy ( Fig . 2 ( b ) ) , indicating that the lattice parameter decreases with increasing temperature as a result of the increased solubility of Si in Al . 
Fig . 5 shows the EDS results for the a - Al matrix in the different Al – 50Si alloys . 
The solubility of Si in Al increases with increasing the HIP temperature , corroborating the XRD results . 
Table 1 shows the density of the Al – 50Si alloys produced by different techniques . 
The density of the deposited alloy is lower than the cast alloy , and then it increases with increasing the HIP temperature . 
Fig . 6 shows the CTE curves resulting from the first heating step for the Al – 50Si alloys prepared under different conditions . 
All the curves show similar trend . 
The CTE increases linearly at low temperature and it shows a relatively sluggish increase at high temperatures . 
At low temperatures , no plastic deformation occurs in the Al matrix , and the expansion of the sample results from the combined expansion of the Al matrix and primary Si particle . 
As a result , the curves increase linearly with increasing temperature . 
However , the interfacial thermal stresses increase and the yield strength of the Al matrix decreases with increasing temperature . 
At high temperatures , when the thermal stresses are higher than the yield strength of the Al matrix , plastic deformation of the matrix may occur . 
Then , the expansion would result from the Al matrix , and primary Si particles as well as from the plastic deformation of the matrix , which may balance part of the expansion due to the Al and Si phases . 
Therefore , although the thermal expansion coefficient still increases at high temperatures , the variation is significantly smaller than at low temperatures . 
The CTE of the as - deposited specimen is much larger than the corresponding cast alloy ( Fig . 6 ) . 
This is in contrast to the investigations reporting that refinement the reinforcement particles and large amount of porosity tend to decrease the CTE [ 23 , 24 ] . 
This unusual phenomenon observed in the spray - deposited alloy can be attributed to the high cooling rate during processing . 
During deposition , a certain amount of Al atoms are dissolved into the primary Si phases , as shown in Fig . 4 . 
This is consistent with the experimental results hown in Fig . 6 . 
The CTE values of the samples after HIP are lower than the deposited alloy , but still higher than the cast alloy ( Fig . 6 ) . 
This is because the Al atoms in Si do not completely precipitate due to the low HIP temperature . 
On the other hand , the solid solubility of Si in Al increases with temperature and the concentration of Si in Al increases with increasing the HIP temperature . 
As shown in Fig . 5 , the concentration of Si in Al increases from 0 . 54 ± 0 . 08 at . % for the as - deposited alloy to 2 . 52 ± 0 . 11 at . % after 843 K HIP . 
The variations in the CTE of the different Al – 50Si alloys during the first and the second heating steps are shown in Fig . 7 as a function of temperature . 
The CTE obtained during the second heating is generally higher than that obtained for the first heating process . 
Similar results have been reported previously [ 24 , 28 , 29 ] . 
For example , Elomari et al . showed that the CTE in the second heating is higher for Al – SiC composites with particle size of 40 l m . 
Rohatgi et al . [ 29 ] observed that the CTE during the second heating was higher for Al - fly ash particles . 
They both attributed the increase of CTE in the second heating step to the emergence of thermal stresses . 
Large residual thermal stresses can cause appreciable matrix yielding during cooling from the fabrication temperature to room temperature due to the CTE mismatch [ 28 , 30 ] . 
In the present study , due to the inherent CTE mismatch between the Al matrix and the primary Si particles , large thermal stresses are induced in the alloy during cooling . 
For the Al – 50Si alloy , the thermal stresses generated around primary Si particles determined in the temperature range from 298 to 773 K is about 686 MPa , which is much higher than the value of the yield strength of pure Al [ 28 , 29 ] . 
Thus , during the CTE measurement , yielding takes place adjacent to the particles , which leads to the increase of the CTE during the second heating . 
Furthermore , Fig . 7 shows that the CTE of the as - deposited alloy during the second heating is smaller than the HIPed alloys . 
This indicates that large residual thermal stresses are generated in the HIPed alloys during the first cooling from 773 K . 
A summary of the physical properties of Al and Si is provided in Table 2 . 
Fig . 8 shows the comparison between calculated and experimental CTE of the different Al – 50Si alloys . 
The experimental CTE for the as - deposited ( Fig . 8 ( a ) ) and 793 K HIP ( Fig . 8 ( b ) ) alloys are smaller than that predicted by the Schapery model in the lower and higher temperature regimes , but it shows good agreement with the Schapery ’ lower bound in the temperature range between 423 K and 673 K . 
At higher temperature , the Turner model better describes the experimental findings . 
The porosity and the different size of the primary Si particles are possibly responsible for this phenomenon . 
The CTE of the 843 K HIP alloy is close to the Turner model ( Fig . 8 ( c ) ) . 
This alloy is completely densified after HIP , which fits well with the assumption of the Turner model . 
However , the experimental CTE of the cast alloy is smaller than both Schapery and Turner models . 
This can be ascribed to the coarse and irregular Si phases in the cast alloy that are not considered in these theoretical models . 
The microstructure and the thermal expansion behavior of spray - deposited , cast and HIPed Al – 50Si alloys have been investigated in detail . 
The following conclusions can be drawn : The microstructure of the as - deposited alloy is composed of primary Si with an average size of 12 . 5 l m and secondary Al phase . 
The CTE of the deposited alloy is higher than the cast alloy due to formation of Si ( Al ) solid solution ; On the other hand , the CTE of HIPed alloys are lower than the parent as - deposited alloy owing to the presence of an Al ( Si ) solid solution . 
The introduction of residual thermal stresses leads to higher CTE as a result of CTE mismatch between the Al matrix and the primary Si particles during the second heating . 
The experimental CTE for the as - deposited material and alloy HIPed at 793 K are in agreement with the lower bound of the Schapery ’ model in the temperature range from 423 to 673 K . 
The CTE of the 843 K HIP alloy is very close to the Turner model . 
Title : The effect of Mn on the microstructure of spray - deposited Al - 20Si - 5Fe - 3Cu - 1Mg alloy 
Hypereutectic Al ± Si alloys are known to be suitable for use as piston materials due to their low coefficient of thermal expansion ( CTE ) and good wear resistance . 
In order to improve the mechanical properties of hypereutectic Al - Si alloys , it is necessary to make composition modi ® cations by adding alloying elements like Cu , Mg , Fe and Ni to the alloys [ 1 ] . 
Although the addition of Cu and Mg may improve the strength of Al alloys substantially through precipitation hardening , the precipitates are not stable at temperatures higher than 150 ° C with the result of the rapid decrease in strength at high temperature . 
Therefore , it is essential to add alloying elements to form stable precipitates at high temperature . 
Recently , focus has been shifted to the continuous improvement in the elevated temperature strength of rapidly solidi ® ed hypereutectic Al - Si alloys [ 2 - 4 ] . 
This is mainly due to the fact that the alloys are needed in various high temperatures circumstances , such as in automotive engines [ 1 , 5 ] . 
It has been reported that Fe is effective in improving high temperature strength [ 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 ] . 
When added with a certain proportion to Al - Si alloys , Fe forms a volume fraction of thermally stable intermetallic compounds , and results in a considerable improvement in the hightemperature performance of these materials . 
Unfortunately , the iron - containing intermetallic compounds formed in spray - deposited hypereutectic Al - Si alloys , such as δ - Al4FeSi2 and β - Al5FeSi , tend to form as needles [ 5 - 7 ] . 
Undoubtedly , the needle - like compounds are very harmful not only to the fracture toughness , but also to the effectiveness of stabilizing the microstructure [ 8 ] . 
It has been proven that alloying elements such as Mn and Cr can change the morphology of the iron - containing intermetallic compounds [ 9 , 10 ] . 
Mn in small quantities is beneficial in the refinement of the microstructure , particularly when iron is present . 
The addition of Mn expands basically the Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 phase ( Chinese script morphology in cast aluminum alloys ) , making the crystallization of Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 phase possible even at high iron contents [ 11 ] . 
In an earlier publication , the microstructural features of Al - 20Si - 5Fe - 3Cu - 1Mg alloy processed by spray deposition were investigated in details [ 12 ] . 
The present work is aimed at understanding the effect of Mn addition on the microstructural evolution of spray - deposited Al - 20Si - 5Fe - 3Cu - 1Mg alloy . 
The investigation was conducted on three alloys with compositions as given in Table1 . 
The base alloy is of type Al ± 20Si ± 5Fe ± 3Cu ± 1Mg ( wt . % ) . 
The amount of Mn in the alloys A1 and A2 is 1 % and 3 % ( wt . % ) , respectively in order to elucidate the effect of Mn addition on the iron - containing compounds of spray - deposited Al - 20Si - 5Fe - 3Cu - 1Mg alloy . 
The spray - forming processing parameters are briefly summarized as follows . 
The melts were superheated to 820 ° C and atomized using nitrogen gas at 0 . 8 MPa pressure . 
The atomizer - substrate distance was 390 mm , and the delivery tube with the diameter of 3 . 1 mm was used . 
The spray - deposited specimens had a cylindrical disc shape with a diameter of about 120 mm . 
The microstructure of the spray - deposited specimens was revealed by etching with Keller ' s reagent . 
The polished and etched specimens were examined under a CAMBRIDGE S360 scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) ® tted with an energy - dispersive X - ray ( EDX ) analysis system . 
X - ray diffraction ( XRD ) analysis was carried out with a Japan Rigaku diffractometer using CuKa radiation ( 40 kV / 25 mA ) . 
The microstructures of the materials were also examined with a H - 800 transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) operating at a voltage of 120 kV . 
TEM disc - shaped specimens were prepared by using ion - beam thinning at a current of 0 . 5 mA and an inclination angle of 15 ° . 
Fig . 1 shows a typical SEM microstructure of the spray - deposited A0 alloy , which is composed of a - Al , Si ( dark gray ) and needle - like compound ( light gray ) . 
From Fig . 1 , one can see that most coarse Si particles are observed at the boundaries of needle - like compound , indicating that the compound surface may act as a nucleation site for these Si crystals . 
An EDX analysis shows that the needle - like compound contains Al , Si and Fe atoms , as shown in Fig . 2 . 
An XRD trace in Fig . 3 obtained from the spray - deposited A0 alloy shows that all the diffraction peaks could be analyzed as a mixture of fcc a - Al , diamond cubic Si , tetragonal δ - Al4FeSi2 and monoclinic β - Al5FeSi compounds . 
The XRD analysis revealed the coexistence of the metastable δ phase and equilibrium β phase in the spray - deposited A0 alloy . 
It is interesting to note that the increase in b phase was coupled with a decrease of the δ phase [ 13 ] . 
As the spray - deposited Al matrix does not contain excess solute atoms , the increase of β phase must have been transformed from the metastable δ phase through a peritectic reaction . 
Fig . 4 ( a ) and ( b ) represents the SEM microstructures of the spray - deposited A1 and A2 alloys , respectively . 
One can see that Mn addition leads to the variation in microstructure of the intermetallic compounds . 
With the addition of 1 wt . % Mn to the spray - deposited A0 alloy , the needle - like compounds were decreased ( Fig . 4a ) and the compounds were eliminated entirely from the final product when 3 wt . % Mn was added to the spray - deposited A0 alloy . 
One can also see from Fig . 4 ( b ) that a high volume fraction of particle - like compound was formed in the microstructure of the spray - deposited A2 alloy . 
An EDX analysis indicates that the particle - like compound contains Al , Si , Fe and Mn atoms , as shown in Fig . 5 . 
Fig . 6 represents the XRD traces with analyzed results , obtained from spray - deposited A1 and A2 alloys , respectively . 
In comparison with Fig . 3 , one can see that the diffraction peaks of δ and β phases in the spray - deposited A1 alloy were weaker than those in the spray - deposited A0 alloy . 
Meanwhile , the Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3 Si2 phase , which can be regarded as a solid solution of Fe in the Al15MnSi2 [ 14 ] , was detected in the spray - deposited A1 and A2 alloys . 
It shows that the needle - like compounds in the spraydeposited A0 alloy were partially replaced by the particle - like Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3 Si2 phase in the spray - deposited A1 alloy , and that the needle - like compounds were replaced entirely by the particle - like Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3 Si2 phase in the spray - deposited A2 alloy . 
TEM analysis continues to show that the particle - like compound in the spray - deposited A2 alloy is Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3 Si2 phase , as shown in Fig . 7 , which is in good agreement with the XRD results , as shown in Fig . 6 . 
The XRD results mentioned previously show that d and b phases are always present in the spray - deposited A0 and A1 alloys . 
According to the Al - Si - Fe ternary phase diagram [ 15 ] , the equilibrium solidification of Al - 20Si - 5Fe alloy starts with the formation of the δ phase at about 820 ° C , followed by the formation of the primary Si phase at below 700 ° C . 
At the temperature below 610 ° C , the formed δ phase transforms into the β phase . 
At about 576 ° C , the ternary eutecticum consisting of the a - Al , Si phase and β phase is formed . 
It is well known that the sequence of equilibrium solidification events should not be followed in spray - deposited hypereutectic Al - Si alloys . 
According to the SEM , EDX and XRD results mentioned above , we might assume that the solidification of the spray - deposited A0 alloy droplets occurs in the following sequence . 
In the beginning of solidification , metastable d phase is crystallized and then primary Si nucleates on the δ phase and grows , as shown in Fig . 1 . 
Finally , the remaining liquid solidified into an irregular ternary eutectic of a - Al , Si and δ phase . 
The reason for the formation of β phase is associated with the thermal condition of impinging droplets . 
The solidification process during spray forming occurs in two stages : gas atomization ( rapid cooling ) and droplet consolidation ( relatively slow cooling ) . 
In case of gas atomization , the δ phase is able to form within droplets to some extent before deposition . 
Upon droplet deposition , an abrupt fall in solidification rate occurs on the deposit layer . 
At this time , the δ phase originated from the droplets can be readily transferred into the stable β phase due to slow cooling effect and due to the fact that δ phase is extremely metastable . 
The crystallization behavior of iron - containing intermetallic compounds in 319 aluminum alloy has been well explained by Narayanan et al . [ 16 ] . 
Unlike the Mn - free Al15Fe3Si2 phase , the Mn - containing Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3 Si2 crystallizes below the liquidus but above the silicon eutectic . 
As a result we may assume that the Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 phase forms first and is followed by the formation of primary Si in the spray - deposited A1 and A2 alloy . 
The Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 phase generally has a dendritic morphology which appears as ' ' Chinese script ' ' in cast aluminum alloys . 
The reason why the Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 is particle - like in the spray - deposited A1 and A2 alloys is that the deformation and fracture experienced in the partially solidified droplets during deposition break the ' ' Chinese script ' ' Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 phase . 
This strengthens the nucleation kinetics of the Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 by increasing the density of nuclei in the top layer of spray - deposited A1 and A2 alloys . 
With the addition of 1 wt . % Mn to the spray - deposited A0 alloy , residual Fe in the spray - deposited A1 alloy can be formed d and b compounds after the Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 phase is crystallized . 
However , all of compounds in the spray - deposited A2 alloy were Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3 Si2 with the addition of 3 wt . % Mn to the spray - deposited A0 alloy . 
In this case , no residual Fe exists in the spray - deposited A2 alloy . 
Thus , needle - like compounds are avoided in the spray - deposited A2 alloy . 
From the results of XRD , SEM , EDX and TEM experiments mentioned previously , one can see that chemical neutralization of Fe with Mn is effective . 
The experimental results have shown that the presence of the needle - like compounds in the spray - deposited Al - 20Si - 5Fe - 3Cu - 1Mg alloy can be avoided on the condition that the Mn / Fe ratio is large than 0 . 6 , keeping the iron level constant at 5 wt . % . 
According to Mocellin [ 8 ] , the β phase has a detrimental influence on the properties when it is in the primary state . 
Its effect may be negligible or even beneficial when it is part of a eutectic . 
Thus , the mechanical properties ( particularly the high - temperature performance ) of spray - deposited Al - 20Si - 5Fe - 3Mn - 3Cu - 1Mg alloy are improved as a result of the needlelike Al - Si - Fe compounds are substituted by the particle - like Al - Si - Fe - Mn compound . 
The precipitation strengthening and mechanical properties of the spray - deposited Al - 20Si - 5Fe - 3Mn - 3Cu - 1Mg alloy will be presented in a separate article . 
The microstructure of spray - deposited Al - 20Si - 5Fe - 3Cu - 1Mg alloy is composed of the a - Al , Si and the needle - like compounds . 
The presence of Mn alters the characteristics of the iron - containing needle - like compounds to the particle - like Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 compound in the spray - deposited Al - 20Si - 5Fe - 3Cu - 1Mg alloy . 
With the addition of 3 wt . % Mn to the spray - deposited Al - 20Si - 5Fe - 3Cu - 1Mg alloy , the needle - like Al - Si - Fe compounds can be substituted by the particle - like Al - Si - Fe - Mn compound . 
Title : Influence of temperature cycles on strength and microstructure of spray - deposited Si – Al CE9F alloy 
This paper investigates the effects of temperature cycles between − 55 ° C and 125 ° C ( the temperature range for intended space application ) on the strength and microstructure of spray deposited Si – Al CE9F alloy . 
After 500 cycles , the strength is significantly improved of 9 % ( i . e . , 26 MPa ) . 
Moreover the Weibull modulus also undergoes a significant increase . 
Microstructure characterizations by XRD , SEM , EBSD and DSC evidence recovery and recrystallization processes in the Al phase , and subgrain development at grain boundaries in the Si phase , leading to lower crystallite size . 
A Hall – Petch dependence of mean strength to average crystallite size in Si is proposed as strengthening mechanism . 
The spray deposited Si – Al CE9F alloy was prepared through atomization process by Osprey Metals Ltd ( Coombs and Dunstan , 1993 ) . 
Ninety 45 × 4 × 3 mm 3 specimens were machined and split into 5 batches intended for different heat treatments . 
A first reference batch of 29 specimens was used for characterizing the as - received material . 
Four batches of 10 or 20 specimens were subjected to 80 , 200 , 500 or 700 temperature cycles performed inside a thermal chamber . 
The cycles consist of 15 min dwell - times at − 55 ° C and 125 ° C , with heating and cooling rates of 20 K min − 1 . 
The microstructure of the as - received material consists of two interpenetrating phases of almost pure Si ( diamond cubic ) and Al ( face - centered cubic ) . 
Indeed , the position of the XRD peaks ( Fig . 1 ) matches the data for either pure Si or pure Al ( standard JCPDS cards No . 00 - 005 - 0565 and 00 - 004 - 0787 , respectively ) . 
Moreover , a comparison of the relative peak intensity for each phase indicates that the grains are macroscopically equiaxed in both phases . 
The two - phase microstructure resulting from spray - deposition is shown in Fig . 2 , where the silicon phase is in light gray and the aluminum phase in dark gray . 
A quantitative analysis of 60 optical microscope pictures ( × 1000 magnification ) taken in three perpendicular planes has shown that the material composition can be homogenized in a 200 μ m edge cube ( the composition assessed by image analysis is 59 . 74 ± 0 . 35 wt . % Si and 40 . 26 ± 0 . 35 wt . % Al ) . 
Moreover , from this analysis , the microstructure seems isotropic at this level . 
EBSD analyses of 200 × 150 μ m 2 areas provide an average grain diameter of 2 . 5 μ m in the Si phase and of 5 μ m in the Al phase . 
The distribution of Si grain diameter is quasi - uniform between 0 . 5 and 3 μ m and includes a few grains up to 10 μ m diameter . 
In the Al phase , the distribution is scattered with a lot of 2 μ m diameter grains and several large grains of diameter up to 15 μ m . 
It seems that the Al grain size is directly related to the gap available between the Si grains ( Fig . 3 ) . 
EBSD analysis of FIB polished surface ( 50 × 50 μ m 2 areas , Fig . 3 ) reveals low local misorientation inside the grains ( i . e . , lower than 0 . 5 ° ( Mohtadi - Bonab et al . , 2015 ) except in the vicinity of a subgrain boundary ) irrespective of the phase considered . 
The analysis of the misorientation at the grain boundaries in both Al ( Fig . 3c ) and Si ( Fig . 3d ) phases shows some subgrain boundaries with misorientation lower than 5 ° . 
The Si phase is characterized by the presence of coherent Σ 3 60 ° / < 111 > twin boundaries in almost each grain ( Fig . 3d ) . 
This kind of twin boundaries has a low surface energy ( 0 . 06 J m − 2 ) ( Phillpot and Wolf , 1990 ; Bristowe , 1998 ; Kohyama et al . , 1986 ) . 
Fig . 4a and b display IPF EBSD maps of large areas ( 200 × 150 μ m 2 ) in Al and Si for a sample mechanically polished . 
These results confirm that the Si phase is highly equiaxed at this scale . 
The Al phase seems to exhibit large areas of a few tens of μ m with similar crystal - lographic orientation ( cf . the green area at the bottom right of Fig . 4a , and the pink area at the top right of Fig . 3a ) even if the grains are not in contact in the image plane , and areas of fine equiaxed microstructure ( at the left of Fig . 3a or at the center of Fig . 4a ) . 
Such features were already evidenced in the microstructure of Si - Al CE7F by Hogg et al . ( 2006 ) . 
Fig . 4c and d display IPF EBSD map of large areas ( 200 × 150 μ m 2 ) in Al and Si for a sample mechanically polished after exposure to 500 temperature cycles between − 55 ° C and 125 ° C . 
The microstructure of the sample subjected to 500 temperature cycles is similar to the one of the as - received material in terms of grain size and crystallographic orientation . 
No quantitative comparison was possible with the available data concerning the fraction of subgrain boundaries in Al , the fraction of twin boundaries in Si , and local misorientation in both phases . 
However , the histogram of misorientation between two adjacent grains indicates that the number of subgrain boundaries in Si ( misorientation lower than 5 ° ) is about twice in Fig . 4d ( after 500 cycles ) than in Fig . 4b ( as - received ) . 
The mean four - point bending strength for each batch is plotted in Fig . 5 versus the number of temperature cycles . 
A significant increase of 9 % , from 283 MPa up to 309 MPa , is evidenced between 0 and 500 cycles . 
The trend of the curve is not linear : an increase of 5 % is already achieved after 80 cycles . 
Between 500 and 700 cycles , no significant change is evidenced , which indicates that the phenomena leading to strength increase do not occur any more after such numbers of temperature cycles . 
Table 1 reports mean , minimum and maximum values of the strength for each batch , as well as the Weibull parameters for 0 , 80 and 500 cycles , for which at least 20 values are available , allowing a proper identification ( Nohut , 2014 ) . 
During the first 80 cycles , mean , minimum and maximum values increase in the same way , as well as σ 0 , whereas the Weibull modulus remains unchanged . 
Between 80 and 500 cycles , the increase in average strength is still significant , but the maximum value and scale parameter only slightly increase , and the minimum value does not change anymore . 
Moreover the Weibull modulus significantly increases , indicating that the strength distribution is narrower . 
The experimental strength distributions after 0 , 80 , 200 , 500 and 700 cycles are plotted in Fig . 6 , as well as the identified Weibull curves for 0 , 80 and 500 cycles . 
The shift toward higher values of the Weibull curve illustrates the increase in strength with the number of temperature cycles . 
The assessment of residual stresses in the Al phase by sin 2 ψ method provides compressive normal stress values about 20 ± 5 MPa and shear stress values of 5 ± 2 MPa for 0 , 200 , 500 and 700 temperature cycles and does not evidence any significant change in the residual stress level with the number of temperature cycles . 
It is noteworthy that the re - sidual stress value is of the order of magnitude of the yield stress of pure aluminum ( between 10 and 20 MPa for purity of 99 . 99 and 99 . 8 % respectively ( Davis , 1993 ) , which indicates that the Al phase has probably undergone plasticity mechanisms during the elaboration of the material . 
The Williamson – Hall analysis of the XRD spectra provides an assessment of the average crystallite size and the average lattice strain from Eq . ( 2 ) , and therefore the dislocation density from Eq . ( 3 ) , in both Al and Si phases . 
These data are plotted respectively in Fig . 7a , c and e versus the number of temperature cycles . 
For comparison purpose , the same data are plotted in Fig . 7b , d and f for samples subjected to heat treatment at 130 ° C for 20 , 50 and 125 h . 
These heat treatments correspond to the time spent at the maximal temperature during 80 , 200 and 500 cycles respectively . 
The results obtained with heat treatments at 200 ° C are identical to those obtained after heat treatments at 130 ° C and are not reported here . 
The average crystallite size in the Si phase decreases of about 30 % during the first 200 cycles and seems to stabilize after 500 cycles with a total decrease close to 35 % ( Fig . 7a ) . 
On the other hand , it seems to stabilize after only 20 h at 130 ° C , with a total decrease close to 25 % ( Fig . 7b ) . 
In the Al phase , the average crystallite size continuously increases with the number of temperature cycles , and achieves an increase of 90 % after 700 cycles ( Fig . 7a ) . 
Heat treatments at 130 ° C lead to an increase of only 65 % after 20 h and a stabilization afterwards ( Fig . 7b ) . 
It is noteworthy that the average crystallite size in both phases is more than one order of magnitude lower than the grain size assessed in Section 3 . 1 . 
The lattice strain in Si phase strongly decreases of about 30 % after 200 temperature cycles and then more slightly to achieve a decrease of 44 % after 700 temperature cycles ( Fig . 7c ) . 
Heat treatment at 130 ° C implies a decrease of 29 % after 20 h , but the lattice strain does not change anymore afterwards ( Fig . 7d ) . 
In the same way , the lattice strain in the Al phase decreases of about 38 % after 200 temperature cycles and 50 % after 700 temperature cycles ( Fig . 7c ) , but remains quite constant during heat treatment at 130 ° C ( Fig . 7d ) after a very low decrease for the first 50 h . 
The dislocation density in the Si phase , assessed from the previous data using Eq . 
( 3 ) , does not undergo any significant change either during temperature cycling ( Fig . 7e ) or during heat treatment at 130 ° C ( Fig . 7f ) . 
On the other hand , in the Al phase , the dislocation density exponentially decreases with the number of cycles , with a decrease of 40 % after 80 temperature cycles and 74 % after 700 temperature cycles ( Fig . 7e ) . 
After 20 h at 130 ° C , the dislocation density has dropped of 50 % and does not undergo any change afterwards ( Fig . 7f ) . 
Fig . 8 compares the DSC thermograms obtained with the as - received material and with a sample previously subjected to 500 temperature cycles . 
Whereas no significant signal is noticeable for the sample subjected to 500 cycles , the as - received material exhibit two exothermic phenomena . 
The first one is spread around 150 – 200 ° C and is of low magnitude and the second one is more sharp and manifests as a peak above 400 ° C . 
Similar results were reported for a strain hardened ( H19 ) commercial 1XXX series alloy in ( Hildebrandt , 1979 ) . 
The low temperature signal consists of several overlapped peaks and is attributed to recovery 
processes . 
The high temperature peak is attributed to recrystallization . 
Recovery peaks were also reported for a recycled aluminum alloy subjected to severe plastic deformation by equal channel angular pressing between 90 and 200 ° C ( attributed to recovery ) , between 200 and 300 ° C ( attributed to recrystallization ) and between 300 and 350 ° C ( attributed to grain growth ) ( Rebhi et al . , 2011 ; Makhlouf et al . , 2012 ) . 
The results of Fig . 8 thus indicate that not only recovery processes , but also recrystallization may have occurred in the Al phase during the 500 temperature cycles since the high temperature peak is not present after 500 cycles . 
The enthalpy corresponding to the first recovery peak between 125 and 250 ° C is about 0 . 03 J g − 1 ( assuming a nominal composition of 40 wt . % Al in the DSC sample ) . 
This value lies in the range reported in ( Rebhi et al . , 2011 ) , between 0 . 01 and 0 . 06 J g − 1 . 
Compressive residual stresses of about 20 ± 5 MPa have been assessed in the Al phase irrespective of the number of temperature cycles . 
This value is close to the yield stress of pure aluminum ( Hildebrandt , 1979 ) and indicates that the Al phase has probably undergone plastic deformation during the elaboration process . 
This is supported by the dislocation density about 10 14 m − 2 in the Al phase ( as - received material ) . 
The compressive state of stress in Al probably develops during hot isostatic pressing , because the coefficient of thermal expansion of Al is higher than the one of Si ( 23 × 10 − 6 K − 1 for Al and 2 . 5 × 10 − 6 K − 1 for Si at 25 ° C ) , what would lead to tensile stresses in Al phase during cooling down to room temperature . 
The identical results obtained by Williamson - Hall analyses after heat treatments at 130 and 200 ° C indicate that the static recovery phenomena are similar in this temperature range and that they are complete after 20 h at 130 ° C and a fortiori at 200 ° C . 
These recovery phenomena are probably related to the first DSC peak spread between 125 and 250 ° C while scanning at 20 K min − 1 ( Fig . 8 ) , and attributed to recovery in ( Rebhi et al . , 2011 ; Makhlouf et al . , 2012 ) . 
These static recovery phenomena manifest by a large increase of the average crystallite size and a large decrease of dislocation density , but only a low decrease of the lattice strain . 
Thanks to cyclic thermomechanical stresses induced by the mismatch of coefficients of thermal expansion , temperature cycles are able to activate dynamic recovery mechanisms that continue the static recovery process . 
This results in further reducing lattice strain and dislocation density and by increasing the average crystallite size . 
The DSC thermograms indicate that the phenomena occurring during temperature cycles , involve mechanisms related to recrystallization since the high temperature peak ( above 400 ° C ) related to recrystallization ( Hildebrandt , 1979 ) has almost fully disappeared after 500 temperature cycles ( Fig . 8 ) . 
It is noteworthy that recrystallization in super - purity aluminum has been reported at temperature as low as 200 ° C ( Perryman , 1954 ) or 250 ° C ( Huang and Humphreys , 1999 ) . 
These static and dynamic recovery phenomena seem to interact during temperature cycles as suggested by the different microstructures obtained after 80 temperature cycles and after 20 h at 130 ° C . 
Indeed , the increase in the average crystallite size is lower and the decrease in lattice strain is higher , after 80 temperature cycles than after 20 h at 130 ° C , despite exposure to cyclic thermomechanical stresses in addition to equivalent thermal exposure . 
However after 200 cycles and 50 h at 130 ° C , the microstructural features obtained by Williamso - Hall analysis are about the same and correspond to the stabilized state after heat treatment at 130 ° C or 200 ° C , which should indicate that the static recovery mechanisms are over . 
The additional microstructure changes occurring after more than 200 cycles are therefore mainly dynamic and involve recrystallization phenomena . 
In the investigated temperature range , dislocation motion in Si is much more difficult ( Priester , 2006 ) than in Al and is not relevant to explain the changes revealed by Williamson – Hall analyses , as confirmed by the almost constant dislocation density provided by Eq . ( 3 ) ( Fig . 7e and d ) . 
However the fraction of subgrain boundaries ( misorientation lower than 5 ° ) is about twice after 500 temperature cycles than in the as - received material ( cf . Section 3 . 2 . 1 ) , and this result is corroborated by the decrease in average crystallite size . 
The rapid cooling of the droplets of molten Si during spray forming might have generated crystal defects such as dislocations , twins , but also vacancies and disordered or ill - defined grain boundaries . 
These latter defects are likely to reorganize and create subgrains with well - defined boundaries instead of ill - defined grain boundaries . 
Such a phenomenon is consistent with the microstructural changes reported here , i . e . , increase in the fraction of subgrain boundaries and decrease of both average crystallite size and lattice strain . 
The characteristics of Al and Si phase microstructure follow close trends ( i . e . , identical results obtained by Williamson – Hall analyses during heat treatments at 130 and 200 ° C , slow down of microstructural changes after 200 temperature cycles , and similar values of average crystallite size and lattice strain after either 80 – 200 cycles or heat treatment for 20 – 50 h ) . 
Together with the previous assumption that changes in Si phase is mainly related to grain boundaries , this could indicate that the interfaces between Al and Si phases are , at least partially , the locus of microscopic changes in Si . 
The average strength of the material undergoes an important increase up to 80 – 200 cycles , and then still increases slowly up to 500 – 700 cycles . 
Such a two - step trend matches the microstructure changes in the Al and Si phases , as described in Sections 4 . 1 and 4 . 2 . 
However , the strength value , about an order of magnitude higher than the yield stress of pure aluminum ( Davis , 1993 ) , and the brittle behavior of the material ( Mauduit et al . , 2016 ) indicate that CE9F fracture is mainly related to the Si phase . 
Indeed , the temperature of brittle to ductile transition in Si is above 500 ° C ( Hirsch and Roberts , 1991 ) . 
The main fracture mechanism in silicon is cleavage along { 111 } planes ( Savage et al . , 1993 ) . 
Evidences of such a fracture mechanism in Si - Al CE9F alloy have been reported in Mauduit et al . ( 2016 ) ( cleavage planes in fracture surfaces ) . 
It is well known from the early work of Petch ( 1953 ) that the Hall – Petch effect is relevant to describe the grain - boundary strengthening of materials undergoing brittle fracture by cleavage . 
Even if the grain size assessed by EBSD does not change with temperature cycles , the strengthening can be related to the decrease of the crystallites size evidenced by the Williamson - Hall analyses . 
Indeed the subgrain size is sometimes the quantity that controls the mechanical properties instead of the grain size ( Ghassemali et al . , 2015 ; McQueen and Hockett , 1970 ) . 
The plot of average strength as a function of average crystallite size ( Fig . 9 ) shows a reasonable agreement of the experimental data with the Hall - Petch law , in view of the dispersion of the results . 
Temperature cycles between − 55 and 125 ° C ( in - use temperature range of space embedded systems ) induce significant changes in the microstructure and strength of the Si - Al CE9F alloy prepared by spray - deposition . 
Recovery and recrystallization occur in the Al phase with a large decrease of the dislocation density . 
Rearrangement at the grain boundaries ( and probably at the interfaces between Al and Si phases , in view of the simultaneous microstructure changes in both phases ) occurs in the Si phase , which leads to a decrease in the average crystallite size . 
By Hall - Petch effect , the Si substructure refinement gives rise to an improvement of up to 9 % of the strength after 500 cycles , and a lower dispersion of strength values . 
Most of these microstructure changes mainly occur between 80 and 200 temperature cycles , and are also observed after heat treatment at 130 ° C for 20 h . 
However , microstructure changes are higher after 500 temperature cycles than after heat treatment . 
This highlights the role , in the mechanisms a work , of the thermomechanical stresses , induced by the mismatch of coefficient of thermal expansion in Al and Si phases . 
Even if the mechanisms at work are still hypothetic and must be further investigated , these results could be exploited to propose a new step in the processing route of chip boxes , in view of a lightening of the components thanks to higher mechanical properties . 
A suitable heat treatment has to be optimized by investigating the effects of heat treatment prior to or in place of temperature cycles . 
Title : Fabrication of spray - formed hypereutectic Al – 25Si alloy and its deformation behavior 
This article reports the fabrication of hypereutectic Al – 25Si alloy , which is expected to be applied to the cylinder liner part of the engine block of an automobile due to its excellent wear resistance , low density and low thermal expansion coefficient , through a spray casting process and the characterization of the microstructural and the mechanical properties of this alloy . 
The OSPREY process used in this study is one of spray forming techniques , which can produce semi - finished products such as billet , tube , and plate with rapid solidification ( RS ) structure and density in a single operation from molten metal . 
The obtained microstructure of the hypereutectic Al – 25Si alloy appeared to consist of Al matrix and equiaxed Si particles with average diameter of 5 – 7 μ m . 
To characterize the deformation behavior of this alloy , a series of load relaxation and compression tests have been conducted at temperatures ranging from RT to 500 ℃ . 
The strain rate sensitivity parameter ( m ) of this alloy has been found to be very low ( ≤ 0 . 1 ) below 300 ℃ and reached maximum value of about 0 . 2 at 500 ℃ . 
During the deformation above 300 ℃ in compression , remarkable strain softening has been observed . 
The extrusion has been successfully conducted at the temperatures of 300 ℃ and above with the ratio of area reduction of 28 and 40 in this study . 
The composition of the present alloy was Al – 25Si . A 15 kg alloy - preform was prepared via the OSPREY spray casting process with the melt temperature of 850 ℃ . 
A schematic drawing of the apparatus used in this study is given in Fig . 1 . The alloy was first melted in a graphite crucible using an induction - heating furnace with a thermocouple placed at the bottom of tundish to monitor the melt temperature . 
The melt stream was then atomized into fine droplets by nitrogen gas at a high pressure , which were deposited onto a substrate positioned at an appropriate distance from the tundish nozzle . 
The diameter of the billet thus obtained was 180 mm . 
After measuring the density distribution of billet , specimens for compression test , load relaxation test , and extrusion were taken from the center part of the billet , having over 97 % of the ideal density . 
The gauge dimensions of specimens were 4 mm × 4 mm × 6 mm for compression tests and 3 mm × 4 mm × 27 mm for load relaxation tests . 
For extrusion , billets of 80 mm in diameter were machined . 
A series of compression and load relaxation tests were then carried out at the temperatures ranging from RT ( 24 ℃ ) to 500 ℃ by using a computer controlled electro - mechanical testing machine ( Instron 1361 model ) , attached with a furnace capable of maintaining the temperature fluctuation within ± 1 ℃ . 
It is well known that load relaxation test can provide a much wider range of strain rates , applying a little amount of plastic strain 1 . 5 % , in this study , to the specimen without an appreciable change in microstructures [ 9 ] . 
Loading strain rate was 5 × 10 ^ - 2s ^ - 1 in all cases . 
In the load relaxation tests employed in this study , the variation of load with time during the tests was monitored through a DVM and stored in a personal computer for the subsequent analysis . 
The flow stresses as a function of inelastic strain rate were determined by following the usual procedure described in the literature [ 10 ] . 
Compression tests were also carried out under the various strain rates ranging from 10 ^ - 4 to 10 ^ - 2s ^ - 1 within the same temperature range . 
After constructing the diagrams of extrusion pressure versus ramspeed from the compression test results , extrusion has been conducted under various conditions . 
Fig . 2 shows the appearance and the density distribution of a spray - cast billet produced in this study . 
The billet was sectioned through a plane with the rotation axis . 
Some pores were observed only in the bottom of the billet . 
The density distribution measured by the Archimedes ’ method are given in Fig . 2 ( b ) exhibiting that the top and the middle parts of the billet have more than 97 % of its ideal density . 
All the specimens for mechanical testing and extrusion have been taken from the part marked by a box in Fig . 2 ( a ) . 
Fig . 3 shows the typical microstructure of the as - spray - cast billet together with the micrograph of IM processed Al – 25Si alloy . As briefly mentioned earlier , coarse primary Si particles ( P ) and AlFeSi based intermetallic phases ( I ) are easily noticed in the IM processed alloy , while the Si particles in the spraycast alloy appear to be very uniform in their size ( ~ 6 μ m ) and distribution . The AlFeSi based intermetallic phases can also be observed in Fig . 3 ( b ) in the form of thin film type . 
The flow curves of strain rate ( ε ) versus stress ( σ ) obtained from a series of load relaxation tests conducted at temperatures from RT to 500 ℃ are given in Fig . 4 in a log scale , showing a wide range of flow data in more than four orders of the strain rates . 
The flow stresses are observed to be very sensitive to the test temperatures . The slope of the flow curve is well known as the strain rate sensitivity parameter ( m ) , characterizing the strain rate dependency of the flow stress and also the measure of high temperature ductility [ 11 ] . 
The m values of spray - cast Al – 25Si alloy are found very small at lower temperatures less than m = 0 . 1 below 300 ℃ but appear to increase remarkably reaching up to about 0 . 2 at 500 ℃ . 
It is very interesting to note that the flow curve obtained at 500 ℃ can be divided into two regions with different m values , suggesting that two different deformation mechanisms might operate for each m value . 
Some compression test results are given in Fig . 5 in terms of the true stress and true strain . 
It should be noted here that the strain - hardening rate is negligible even at the room temperature . 
At higher temperatures , strain softening can be observed , though the degree of which is not remarkable . The flow curves of log strain rate ( ε ) versus log stress ( σ ) can also be obtained from the compression test results , plotting the flow stresses evaluated at the strain level of 1 % as a function of the initial strain rates , as shown in Fig . 6 . 
This result shows somewhat smaller m values than those calculated from load relaxation tests . 
From the earlier theoretical and experimental work , materials with a high degree of flow softening and low m value are known to be prone to a severe shear localization [ 12 ] . 
Although the present alloy shows low m values , it can obviously be hot - worked at the temperatures above 300 ℃ because the degree of flow softening is relatively low and the m value increases steeply as the test temperature increases . 
Fig . 7 shows the relations between the extrusion pressure and ram - speed for the extrusion ratios of r = 28 and 40 , obtained from Eqs . ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) using the flow data in Fig . 6 . 
During extrusion , it is necessary to control the working pressure below the endurance pressure of the machine . 
The critical pressure is evaluated as 1072 MPa in the case of this study and marked by the horizontal lines in Fig . 7 . 
A series of experimental extrusions were successfully conducted at the ram - speeds of 1 – 10 mm s ^ - 1 , for the extrusion ratios of r = 28 and 40 and at the various temperatures above 300 8C . 
Typical microstructures taken before and after the extrusion , with the condition of r ¼ 28 and T = 400 ℃ , are shown in Fig . 8 exhibiting Si particles refined into an average size of about 2 mm after extrusion . 
The 180 mm diameter billet of a hypereutectic Al – 25Si alloy with over 97 % of ideal density , was produced using the OSPREY spray casting process in this study . 
The Si particles were found to be uniform in both the distribution and their size . 
The strain rate sensitivity parameter ( m ) of this alloy has been observed to be very low ( ≤ 0 . 1 ) below 300 8C but to reaches the maximum value of about 0 . 2 at 500 8C from a series of load relaxation and compression tests . 
The diagrams of ram - speed versus extrusion pressure for this alloy were constructed from the compression test results , providing the extrusion conditions . 
The effectiveness of these diagrams has been confirmed experimentally by conducting extrusions under the various conditions . 
After an extrusion , the Si particles were observed to refine into much a smaller size of about 2 μ m . 
Title : Effect of Cr and Mn on the microstructure of spray - formed Al – 25Si – 5Fe – 3Cu alloy 
The hypereutectic Al – Si – Fe alloys with different Mn and Cr addition were synthesized by spray forming technique , and the microstructural evolutions induced by Mn and Cr have been investigated using ﬁ eld emission scanning electron microscopy ( FE - SEM ) , X - ray diffraction ( XRD ) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) . 
The results show that the modi ﬁ cation effect of co - addition of Mn and Cr is more effective than the individual Mn or Cr addition in transforming harmful rod - like Fe - bearing β phase to particulate α - phase . 
Meanwhile , the modi ﬁ cation effect of Cr is superior to that induced by Mn . 
The Mn / Cr ratio plays an important role in the combined addition . 
The addition of 2 wt % Mn + 1 wt % Cr to spray formed alloy has induced an ideal microstructure with entirely ﬁ ne granular intermetallic compounds dispersed in Al matrix . 
DSC analyses indicate that both Mn and Cr can greatly in ﬂ uence the onset temperatures and the region widths of primary Si , δ phase and α phase , but bring little changes on multi - phase reaction , which would contribute to the modi ﬁ catsion effects of Mn , Cr and Mn + Cr . 
The investigation was performed on six alloys and the Al – 25 wt % Si – 5 wt % Fe – 3 wt % Cu was selected as base alloy ( denoted as SF - B ) , and the others were shown in Table 1 . 
The raw materials included pure Al ( 99 . 7 % purity ) , Al – 40Si ( Si content : 40 % , other impurities ≤ 0 . 5 wt % , Al balanced ) and Al – 50Cu ( Cu content : 50 % other impurities ≤ 0 . 5 wt % , Al balanced ) master alloys , and commercial Fe - ( 75 wt % Fe , the rest is ﬂ ux ) , Mn - ( 75 wt % Mn , the rest is ﬂ ux ) , Cr ( 60 wt % Cr , the rest is ﬂ ux ) additives . 
All binary master alloys and other alloying elements used in the present study were obtained from Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials and Beijing general institute of mining & metallurgy respectively . 
The master alloys and alloying elements were ﬁ rst melted together in an induction melting furnace and superheated to 1153 – 1203 K . 
Then , the superheated melts were atomized into droplets by nitrogen gas and the droplets were deposited on a rotating substrate to form a three dimensional preform . 
The details of the spray forming process can be found in Ref . 
[ 25 ] . 
All the specimens were cut from the center part of the sprayformed alloys . 
The microstructure was studied by means of FE - SEM , XRD , TEM , and DSC . 
Specimens for all FE - SEM ( ZEISS SUPRA55 equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy ( EDS ) ) observations were prepared by the standard metallographic procedures using SiC abrasive paper , 2 . 5 μ m diamond polishing paste and Keller ’ s reagent . 
The thin foils for TEM studies were mechanically polished ﬁ rstly and ﬁ nally ion milled in a dual ion - beam miller at a current of 0 . 5 mA , and the thin foils were examined in a HITACHI H - 800 TEM ( equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy , EDS ) operated at 200 kV . 
X - ray diffraction ( XRD ) analyses were carried out with Philips APD - 10 diffractometer using Cu K α radiation ( 40 kV / 150 mA ) . 
The DSC experiments were performed on a NETZSCH STA 409C / CD DSC instrument at the cooling rate of 10 K / min . The weight of each specimen for DSC analysis was 5 – 6 mg . 
Thearea fraction of rod - like and block - like phases was analyzed by ImageTools 1 . 0 software . 
The microstructure of SF - B alloy can be described as consisting of white rod / needle - like phase and bright white phase besides Al matrix and grey Si particles as shown in Fig . 1 ( a ) . 
The area fraction of these rod - like phases is about 10 ± 0 . 3 % as listed in Table 2 . The XRD result [ Fig . 1 ( b ) ] identi ﬁ es the presence of β - Al5FeSi , δ - Al4FeSi2 and Al2Cu phases in the alloy . 
For the white short - rod like particle , the EDS analysis ( Table 3 ) has disclosed a composition of Al4 . 72 FeSi1 . 14 or Al3 . 32 FeSi2 . 4 that is close to β - Al5FeSi or δ - Al4FeSi2 respectively . 
Taking into account the results of the XRD and EDS analyses , it can be deduced that the white short - rod phase might be ␤ - Al5 FeSi / δ - Al4FeSi2 . 
However , it is dif ﬁ cult to de ﬁ nitely differentiate these two Fe - bearing phases each other for the extreme similarity on their sizes and morphologies . 
The coupled results of EDS and XRD analyses also con ﬁ rm the bright white phase to be Al2Cu . 
Fig . 2 ( a ) presents the typical SEM micrograph of SF - M2 alloy consisting of Al matrix , grey Si particles ( pointed out by arrow A ) , rod / needle - like ( pointed out by arrow B ) , blocky ( pointed out by arrow C ) and granular ( pointed out by arrow D ) white intermetallic compounds . 
The rod - like intermetallics has a size in length ranging from 30 to 45 μ m with an aspect ratio ≥ 4 , the blocky intermetallics were about 4 – 8 μ m , and the ﬁ ne granular intermetallics is less than 3 μ m . 
The total area fraction of such rod - like and blocky intermetallics is about 8 . 52 ± 0 . 06 % . 
From the insert in Fig . 2 ( a ) some bright white granular intermetallics ( pointed out by arrow E ) can also be seen . 
Coupled EDS results with XRD analysis , it can be determined that the white rod - / needle - like intermetallic compounds is β - Al5 ( Fe , Mn ) Si phase , the white granular particles are α - Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 phase and the bright white phase was Al2Cu phase . 
The δ - Al4 FeSi2 phase is not detected by XRD analysis , as shown in Fig . 2 ( b ) . 
Fig . 3 shows the SEM micrograph and the XRD pattern of SF - C2 alloy . 
The SF - C2 alloy is also consisted of Al matrix , grey Si particles ( arrow A ) , white rod - like ( arrow B ) , and blocky ( arrow C ) or granular ( arrow D and arrow E ) intermetallics . 
The rod - like compounds are estimated to be about 20 μ m in length accompanied by an aspect ratio of less than 3 , the blocky particle is about 10 – 20 μ m , and the size of those ﬁ ne granular particles is the same as those in SF - M2 alloy . 
According to XRD and EDS results , both rod - like and blocky intermetallics are identi ﬁ ed to be β - Al5 ( Fe , Cr ) Si , and the white granular compound and the bright white intermetallics are α - Al15 ( Fe , Cr ) 3Si2 and Al2Cu , respectively . 
The total area fraction of rod - like and blocky β - Al5 ( Fe , Cr ) Si is about 4 . 22 ± 0 . 05 % , which is much smaller than that in SF - M2 alloy . 
Obviously , the addition of Cr to the spray formed Al – 25Si – 5Fe – 3Cu alloy leads to a marked decrease of β phase and the appearance of blocky β - Al5 ( Fe , Cr ) Si with a large size and a small aspect ratio . 
The typical SEM image and corresponding XRD pattern of SFMC11 alloy are shown in Fig . 4 . 
One can see that the rod - like ( arrow B ) , blocky ( arrow C ) and granular ( arrow D , arrow E ) intermetallic compounds are present accompanied by primary Si ( arrow A ) and Al matrix . 
The long rod - like particle has a length less than 25 μ m with an aspect ratio of 4 – 8 . 
The blocky particle has a size less than 10 μ m . 
The granular intermetallic particle is less than 3 μ m . 
According to of the XRD and EDS analyses , both the rodlike and blocky phases are β - Al5 ( Fe , Mn , Cr ) Si , while the granular phases are α - Al15 ( Fe , Mn , Cr ) 3Si2 and Al2Cu , respectively . 
Evidently , the co - addition of Mn and Cr is helpful to reduce the sizes of blocky particles . 
The area fraction of both rod - like and blocky intermetallic particles is about 7 . 99 ± 0 . 13 % , which is less than that in the SF - M2 alloy but a little more than that in the SF - C2 alloy . 
Compared with the SF - M2 and SF - C2 alloys , the SF - MC11 alloy is more hopeful to further re ﬁ ne during post process such as hot extrusion . 
Further increasing Mn / Cr content in spray formed alloys with co - addition of Mn and Cr will hardly change the microstructural constituents , but obviously change the microstructural features as revealed in Fig . 5 ( SF - MC12 alloy ) and Fig . 6 ( SF - MC21 alloy ) . 
From Fig . 5 , it can be found that the large blocky and coarse rod - like white intermetallics found in Fig . 1 ∼ Fig . 4 is replaced by very few ﬁ ne needle - like and small blocky intermetallic compounds . 
The ﬁ ne needle - like intermetallics range from 10 to 20 μ m with an aspect ratio ≥ 3 , and the size of the small blocky compounds is less than 7 μ m . 
The total area fraction of such ﬁ ne needle - like and small blocky intermetallics is about 5 ± 0 . 05 % . 
Detailed studies on microstructural feature of SF - MC21 alloy had been performed in early published work [ 25 ] , so , it is not necessary to repeat those results . 
Compared with other alloys , the SF - MC21 alloy has the lowest area fraction of 2 . 0 ± 0 . 06 % for both rod - like and blocky particles as shown in Fig . 6 . 
If β - type phase is only those rod - like and blocky particles , the content of β phase in Fig . 6 is too low to be detected by the XRD method due to its resolving limit . 
Considering both the XRD and SEM results coupled with the resolving ability of XRD method , one can conclude that the actual content of Fe - bearing β phase in the SF - MC21 alloy should be larger than that found in SEM graph . 
That is to say , some of the β phase particles must have a granular shape . 
If it is true , the combination of co - addition of Mn and Cr with spray forming technique could also change the morphology of β - phase from harmful rodlike shape to less harmful granular shape . 
Thus the harmful effect induced by rod - like or needle - like β - phase can be reduced or eliminated . 
Then it is not necessary to completely transform harmful rod - like or needle - like Fe - bearing β phase to harmless compact α - phase by adding large content of Mn or Cr , which will bring the risk of sludge formation in the melt [ 26 ] . 
However , further investigations about the effect of Mn + Cr addition coupled with SF process on β phase morphology need to be conducted in detail . 
On the other hand , the XRD results of SF - MC21 and SF - MC12 alloys also indicate that the co - addition of 3 % ( Mn + Cr ) to spray - formed alloys is still not enough to entirely transform Fe - containing β intermetallics to ﬁ ne granular α - type intermetallics , which is consistent with our earlier research [ 19 ] in which an ideal modi ﬁ ed microstructure could be achieved only on the condition that the value of the Mn / Fe ( wt % ) ratio is about 1 . 0 . 
Apart from the round intermetallics reported in Ref . 
[ 25 ] , the polygonal intermetallics are also present in the alloys with coaddition of Mn and Cr , as shown in Fig . 7 . 
The size of the small polygonal intermetallic particle is about 3 – 5 μ m , which is consistent with those of intermetallics shown in the inserts of SEM images . 
EDS analysis also shows that the polygonal intermetallic phases contained elements of Al , Si , Fe , Mn and Cr . 
The abilities of Mn , Cr and Mn + Cr in modifying harmful Febearing phase can be explained based on the cooling circle DSC analyses . 
The DSC patterns of SF - B , SF - C2 , SF - M2 , SF - MC12 and SFMC21 alloys are shown in Figs . 8 and 9 , respectively . 
The peaks in DSC traces and possible phase transformations during the cooling were listed in Table 4 . 
As shown in Fig . 8 , four exothermic peaks appeared in the DSC trace of SF - B alloy . 
Three small exotherms with onset temperature of 1076 K , 997 K and 789 K may correspond to crystallization of primary Si , δ - Al4FeSi2 , and quaternary eutectic , respectively , and the sharp exothermic peak with an onset temperature of 831 K may correspond to a ternary eutectic solidi ﬁ cation , which is in agreement with the ternary Al – Fe – Si phase diagram [ 29 ] . 
The solidi ﬁ cation sequence of the SF - B alloy can been described as follows : the primary Si is formed ﬁ rstly ( peak 1 ) , followed by precipitating the non - equilibrium δ - Al4FeSi2 ( peak 2 ) . During cooling between peak2 and peak4 , the δ - Al4FeSi2 phase is transformed to β - Al5FeSi phase . 
When the temperature reaches peak4 , the eutectic reaction L → Al + Si + Al5FeSi will take place . Finally , the remaining liquid solidify into quaternary eutectic of Al + Si + θ - Al2Cu + Al5FeSi corresponding to peak 5 region . 
Thermo gram ’ s shape is in ﬂ uenced by the Mn or Cr addition in the examined alloys . 
When 2 wt % Mn or 2 wt % Cr is added to SF - B alloy , not only a new reaction ( peak 3 ) corresponding to the crystallization of α - Al15 ( Fe , TM ) 3Si2 is introduced into the DSC traces , but the onset temperatures of the thermal reactions are changed as well . 
The four small exothermic peaks marked as 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 ware corresponding to the crystallization of primary Si , δ - Al4 ( Fe , TM ) Si2 , α - Al15 ( Fe , TM ) 3Si2 and quaternary eutectic , respectively , and the sharp exothermic peak denoted as 4 is corresponding to a ternary eutectic solidi ﬁ cation . 
According to the literatures [ 19 , 25 , 28 ] , the solidi ﬁ cation sequence of the spray formed alloys with the addition of Mn or Cr can be described as follows : primary Si is formed ﬁ rstly ( peak 1 ) , followed by precipitation of non - equilibrium δ - Al4 ( Fe , TM ) Si2 ( peak 2 ) . 
During cooling between peak2 and peak3 , the formed δ - Al4 ( Fe , TM ) Si2 phase transforms to β - Al5 ( Fe , TM ) Si . When the temperature reaches peak3 , the β - Al5 ( Fe , TM ) Si and the residual δ - Al4 ( Fe , TM ) Si2 phase will react peritectically with liquid to form α - Al15 ( Fe , TM ) 3Si2 phase . 
After that , a ternary eutectic consisting of α - Al , Si , and α - Al15 ( Fe , TM ) 3 Si2 will form at peak 4 region . Finally , the remaining liquid solidify into quaternary eutectic of Al + Si + θ - Al2Cu + Al15 ( Fe , TM ) 3 Si2 at peak 5 region . 
Compared with SF - B alloy , the addition of Mn or Cr causes a little change of the starting temperature of peaks 4 and 5 , but a marked change of peaks 1 and 2 . 
Both Mn and Cr addition can greatly decrease the onset precipitation temperature of primary Si phase and increase the onset temperature of peak 2 . 
The addition of Cr is more effective in decreasing the onset temperature of peak 1 but less effective in increasing the starting temperature of peak 2 than Mn . 
The addition of Mn or Cr can also broaden peak 1 but narrow peak 2 . 
From Table 4 , one can ﬁ nd that , in the SF - C2 alloy , peak 3 has a much lower starting temperature than its counterpart in the SF - M2 alloy , and overlaps with the sharp peak 4 , corresponding to a ternary eutectic reaction . 
Thus , it can be considered that the low onset temperature and narrow temperature range of peak 2 are favorable to the formation of ﬁ ne δ phase and the complete transformation of δ phase to β phase . 
The low onset temperature of peak 3 can ease the transformation of β phase to α phase . 
Accordingly , lower content of ␤ phase will be retained in the SF - C2 alloy . In addition , phase transformation from β phase to α - phase could be occurred with eutectic solidi ﬁ cation process of the melt because of the overlapping of peak 3 and peak 4 , as shown in Fig . 8 . 
As such , more β phase can be transformed to α - phase in the SF - C2 alloy . 
As a result , lower content of β phase is left in the SF - C2 alloy than that in the SF - M2 alloy . 
Compared with the SF - M2 alloy , the addition of Cr to SF - M2 alloy causes the further decrease of the starting temperature of primary Si and the further narrowing of the width of peak 2 in SF - MC21 alloy as shown in Fig . 9 . 
Contrarily , the starting temperature of α - phase is further increased , accompanying by expansion of α - phase region . The same changes also happen in the SF - MC12 alloy when Mn was added to SF - C2 alloy . 
The high onset temperature and expanded region of peak 3 are more favorable to the long distance diffusion of Mn , Cr , Fe and Si atoms in Al melts and pre - solidi ﬁ ed phases such as β - phase . 
And thus a complete transformation from ﬁ ne β - phase to α - phase can take place , and more α - phase can be formed in the exterior of the coarse β - particle . 
With the exfoliation of α - phase formed at the periphery of the coarse β - phase during spray forming process , the coarse β - phase particles will gradually decrease and re ﬁ ne . 
Obviously , the ﬁ ne β - phase particle can be easily fragmentized to particulates by impingement and shear force of turbulent ﬂ uid during spray forming process [ 17 ] . 
Considering above analysis , more addition of Mn or Cr can cause a better microstructure in the SF alloys . 
Compared the SF - MC21 alloy with the SF - MC12 alloy , one can ﬁ nd that the modi ﬁ cation effect induced by 2 wt % Mn + 1 wt % Cr co - addition is superior to that induced by 1 wt % Mn + 2 wt % Cr coaddition , which implies that the Mn / Cr ratio play an important role in the microstructural modi ﬁ cation . 
This can be also explained by their DSC patterns . 
As mentioned above , Mn was more effective in increasing both precipitation temperatures of β - and α - phase than Cr . 
The onset temperature of α - phase in the SF - MC21 alloy is much higher than that in the SF - MC12 alloy , but the width of α - phase regions in both alloys is nearly equal . 
Therefore , the transformation of β to α - phase may depend more on the starting precipitation temperature of α - phase than on the width of α - phase region . 
In a thermal activating process , a higher temperature is always more favorable to the diffusion of alloying elements , especially to the diffusion of those elements with low diffusion coef ﬁ cient . 
Meanwhile , transformation of β - phase to α - phase could be occurred more easily and completely . 
That is why an ideal microstructure could be achieved easily in the SF - MC21 alloy . 
Both the addition of Mn or Cr can modify the characteristics of the intermetallics in the spray - formed alloys through changing the phase precipitation region . 
In the case of single addition , Cr is more effective in decreasing the content of harmful rod - like β - phase than Mn . 
With the same total content of alloying elements , the composite modi ﬁ cation effect caused by co - addition of Mn and Cr is superior to that induced by individual addition of Mn or Cr . 
With the increase of the content of Mn + Cr , the onset temperature of the precipitation of α - phase increases accompanied by the broadening of the α - phase precipitation temperature range , and the volume fraction and size of rod - like β - phase are also reduced gradually . 
Mn / Cr ratio plays an important role in optimizing microstructure on the condition that Mn and Cr co - exist in the SF alloys . 
The co - addition of 2 wt % Mn + 1 wt % Cr has produced an ideal microstructure with entirely ﬁ ne granular intermetallic compounds in the studied alloys . 
Meanwhile , the morphology of such Fe - rich β phase can also be changed from traditional rod - like shape to granular one by the co - addition of Mn and Cr , coupled with the spray forming technique . 
The details of this change need further investigation . 
Wear behavior of secondary processed spray formed Al - 28Si - 5Cu - 4Mg alloy 
In the present study Al - 28Si - 5Cu - 4Mg alloy has been spray formed and hot pressed for densification . 
Hot pressing refined the microstructure and reduced the porosity in the spray formed alloy from 10 to 1 % . 
The microstructure of spray formed and hot pressed alloy exhibited equiaxed grain morphology with fine and uniform distribution of both primary and eutectic Si with fine needles of Q - Al12Si7Mg4Fe intermetallics and Chinese script like θ Al2Cu precipitates in α - Al matrix . 
The size of Si particles ranged from 3 – 10 µ m . 
In contrast the microstructure of as - cast alloy consisted of coarse primary and eutectic Si , long needles of Q - Al - Si - Mg - Cu - Fe phase and bright grey θ - Al2Cu phase in the α - Al matrix . 
The size of primary Si varied from 30 – 250 µ m . 
The spray formed and hot pressed alloy exhibited a higher hardness compared to the as - cast alloy . 
The wear behavior of both the alloys , under dry sliding conditions , showed an increase in the wear rate with an increase in the load . 
However , the spray formed and hot pressed alloy exhibited maximum wear resistance and minimum coefficient of friction , while as - cast alloy exhibited minimum wear resistance and maximum coefficient of friction over the entire range of applied load . 
The high wear resistance and high hardness of spray formed and hot pressed alloy are explained in the light of its microstructural modifications induced during spray forming and subsequent hot pressing and also the topographical features of worn surfaces and morphology of debris particles . 
The chemical composition of Al - 28Si - 5Cu - 4Mg alloy is shown in Table 1 . 
The details of spray forming set up employed in the present study have been described elsewhere [ Raj08 ] . 
In brief , spray forming process employed an annular convergent - divergent nozzle to create a spray of melt . 
In each run 2 . 5 kg of alloy has been melted to a temperature of 1018 ° C in a resistance heating furnace . 
The molten metal is atomized by nitrogen ( N2 ) gas . The resultant spray is deposited over a Cu substrate resulting in a near net shaped preform . The process variables employed in spray forming are listed in Table 2 . 
Specimens of size 100 x 30 x 20 mm were cut from the preforms . 
The specimens were hot pressed at a pressure of 55 MPa and a temperature of 480 ° C for densification . The density of spray formed alloys was measured by using Archimedes principle as per ASTM : B962 – 08 . The percentage of porosity ( % P ) in the spray formed alloys was measured by using the actual density ( ρ ac ) and the theoretical density ( ρ th ) of the alloys using the relation , % P = [ 1 - ( ρ ac / ρ th ) ] x 100 . 
Samples were extracted from as - cast , as - spray formed and spray formed and hot pressed Al - 28Si - 5Cu - 4Mg alloys for microstructural examination . 
The samples were prepared by polishing using standard metallographic techniques of grinding on emery paper with 1 / 0 , 2 / 0 , 3 / 0 and 4 / 0 specifications . 
Final polishing was done on a wheel cloth using brasso and kerosene . 
The polished samples were etched with Keller ’ s reagent ( 1 % vol . hydrofluoric acid ( HF ) , 1 . 5 % vol . hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) , 2 . 5 % vol . nitric acid ( HNO3 ) and rest water ) . 
The microstructures of samples were examined under a ZEISS Optical Microscope and Scanning Electron Microscopy ( Model : S - 3400N Hitachi Model ) . 
Wear tests were conducted on as - cast and spray formed and hot pressed alloy specimens on a pin - on - disc wear testing machine ( Model : TR - 20 , DUCOM ) as per ASTM : G99 – 05 . 
The counterpart disc was made of quenched and tempered EN - 32 steel having a surface hardness of 65HRC . 
Wear specimens of size Ø 8 × 30 mm were machined out from both the alloys . 
The specimens were polished and then cleaned with acetone before conducting the test . 
The wear tests were conducted by varying the load from 10 – 70 N at a sliding velocity of 1 . 5 m / s and a sliding distance of 1025 m . 
The worn surfaces and the debris particles of both the alloys after wear testing were examined under Scanning Electron Microscopy . 
The hardness of the alloys was measured by Vickers Hardness Tester ( Mattoon ATK - 600 ) at an applied load of 300 g as per ASTM : E384 – 11e1 . 
Fig . 1 ( a ) shows the optical microstructure of as - cast Al - 28Mg - 5Cu - 4Mg alloy . 
The microstructure consists of coarse primary Si with eutectic network of Al - Si phase together with the intermetallic phases . 
Fig . 1 ( b ) shows the optical microstructure of as - spray formed alloy , which is composed of uniformly distributed primary Si particles , intermetallic secondary phases containing Cu and Mg in Al - matrix . 
The microstructure shows a significant difference to its as - cast counterpart . 
It is observed from the Fig . 1 ( b ) that the primary Si particulates and fine needle shaped intermetallics are evenly distributed in Al - matrix . 
The presence of fine , spherical and approximately 10 % of porosity has been observed in the as - spray formed alloy . 
Fig . 1 ( c ) shows the optical micrograph of spray formed and hot pressed alloy . 
It can be observed from the figure that there is a fragmentation of Si and brittle θ and Q intermetallics in the Al - matrix and porosity has been reduced to 1 % . 
The SEM micrograph of as - cast alloy shown in Fig . 2 ( a ) is mainly composed of polygonal block like Si , dark grey colored needles of Q - Al68Si13Mg8Cu6Fe4 phase and bright grey θ - Al2Cu phase in the form of Chinese script . 
The SEM micrograph of as - spray deposited alloy is shown in Fig . 2 ( b ) . 
The microstructure of alloy exhibited coexisting faceted primary Si particles and fine plates of complex intermetallic phases . 
The size of Si particles varied from 3 to 10 µ m compared to large particle size of 150 µ m in as - cast alloy . 
The various phases present are grey colored Si particulates as a major element , grey colored intermetallic Q - Al48Si29Mg18Fe4 phase and bright white phase of θ - Al2Cu . 
The solidification of as - cast Al - 28Si - 5Cu - 4Mg alloy , due to slow cooling rate and broad temperature interval between the liquidus and solidus of higher Si content in the pseudo binary section will cause castings with a coarse plate like Si , needle like Q and Chinese script like Al2Cu phases . 
In spray forming process , the solidification phenomena changes due to the effect of high cooling rate during the atomization stage and the unique microstructural evolution mechanism after deposition . 
As the cooling rate increases during atomization , the droplets experience a large under cooling prior to nucleation of primary Si phase leading to refinement . 
Simultaneously , reduced temperature suppresses the growth of these phases even after the deposition . 
Thus , large amount of fine and uniformly distributed Si and greater number of precipitates ( Al2Cu phase , Q phase ) are seen in the as - spray formed alloy . 
The dendritic as well as the Chinese script structures observed in the as - cast alloy are modified and it is difficult to discern the difference between primary Al2Cu and Q phases . 
Hot pressing of as - spray formed alloy led to a considerable reduction in porosity , grain recovery and recrystallization to a certain extent . 
The preheat treatment before compression process makes the microstructure more uniform . 
Secondly , hot deformation leads to micro structural refinement and solid - state phase transformation . 
The severe stress imposed by hot compression generates high density dislocations in the grains . 
Subsequently , the movement and arrangement of dislocations form a lot of small angle grain - boundaries , refining initial grains into several substructures . 
In addition to the refinement of grains , hot deformation also promotes homogeneous precipitation hardening of θ phase and Q phase which can pin the movement of dislocations to restrain grains coarsening during recrystallization effectively [ Est90 ] . 
The results of hardness measurement show that the hardness of spray formed and hot pressed alloy is ( 142 VHN ) higher than that observed in the as - cast alloy ( 82 VHN ) . 
The higher hardness of spray formed + hot pressed alloy can be atributed to the microstructrural refinement of θ - Al2Cu and Q phases owing to the rapid solidification effect and partial recrystallization , fragmentation of θ - Al2Cu and Q phases further and reduced porosity due to hot pressing . 
The hardness of the spray formed and hot pressed alloy is nearly 1 . 75 times higher than that of the as - cast alloy . 
The microstructural changes from as - cast to spray formed and hot pressed alloy could lower the stress concentration at the interface of Q phase and a - Al matrix . 
Therefore , the tendency to initiate subsurface cracks is reduced leading to an increased hardness in spray formed and hot pressed alloy [ Sha07 , Hua09 ] . 
Fig . 3 ( a ) shows the variation of wear rate with applied load and Fig . 3 ( b ) shows the variation of coefficient of friction with load for as - cast and spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu - 4Mg alloys at a sliding speed of 1 . 5 m / s and a sliding distance of 1025 m respectively . 
The wear rate increased as the load increased in both the alloys . 
It was observed that there is a remarkable difference in the wear rate , particularly at higher loads , in both the alloys . 
The wear rate of as - cast alloy is approximately 3 times higher than that of the spray formed and hot pressed alloy . 
The microstructural features like morphology , size and distribution of hard intermetallics ( Q - phase ) and θ - Al2Cu precipitates have a large influence on the dry sliding wear behavior of alloy [ Haq01 ] . 
The long needles of intermetallic Q - phase and coarse θ Al2Cu phase appear to have played an important role in aggravating the wear process in ascast alloy . 
The sharp edges of intermetallic Q - phase may have acted as crack nucleation sites resulting in a stress concentration that is more severe at the interface between the tip of needle - like intermetallic Q - phase and the Al - matrix [ Wan04 ] that led to the fracture of long needles of Q - phase resulting in a high wear rate in as - cast alloy . The spray formed and hot pressed alloy showed lower wear rate compared to the as - cast alloy . The reduction in porosity , recrystallization and fragmentation of Q - phase and Al2Cu phase , their uniform distribution in the matrix of spray formed and hot pressed alloy , decrease the stress concentration between the fine needles of Q - phase and the matrix and increase the strength of matrix due to fine dispersion of Al2Cu resulting in an improved wear resistance . 
At low loads , more time is available for the formation and growth of micro - welds , which increases the force needed to shear - off the micro - welds to keep the relative motion and this leads to an increase in wear resistance . 
An increase in the load results in the rise of the interface temperature that engenders oxidation and thermal softening of material . The brittle and discrete oxide film is harmful because it acts as a hard impurity or third body between mating surfaces [ Ana09 ] . 
The wear rate with normal load shows a linear relation up to the load of 30 N . 
Further increase in the load to 70 N shows an abrupt increase in wear rate indicating a change in the wear mechanism . 
At high loads , the thermal softening of the alloy in the sub surface region takes place leading to a large scale plastic deformation [ Moh96 ] . 
Under such conditions , metallic wear takes place . 
The remarkable observation in the present study is that the fine distribution of Q - phase and a good interfacial bonding at the interface with the matrix provided by the fine precipitates of θ - Al2Cu , allows for high temperature stability leading to a low wear rate in spray formed and hot pressed alloy compared to that of as - cat alloy . 
It can be observed that coefficient of friction is lowest for the spray formed and hot pressed alloy and highest for as - cast alloy however ; the variation of coefficient of friction with load is very small and can be assumed to be constant for both alloys over the entire range of load ( Fig . 3 ( b ) ) . 
The SEM micrographs of worn surface of Al - 28Si - 5Cu - 4Mg alloys at a load of 70 N are shown in Fig . 4 . 
The worn surface of as - cast alloy shown in Fig . 4 ( a ) consists of ploughing marks and a large number of pits indicating a high wear rate . The heavy damage may be due to the presence of long needles of Q - phase and coarse θ - Al2Cu phase and their uneven distribution in the alloy . 
It seems that the coarse phases are readily fractured and broken off during wear weakening the matrix leading to a high wear rate . 
In contrast the worn surface of spray formed and hot pressed alloy shown in Fig . 4 ( b ) consists of light scoring marks and shallow dimples in one or two regions clearly indicating a low wear rate . 
This may be due to the refinement in the microstructure where the Q - phase and θ - Al2Cu phase have been finely divided and uniformly distributed in the matrix . 
This fine dispersion provides strength to the matrix and the bonding between these phases and the matrix is strong enough to retain them to the matrix during wear leading to a low wear rate [ Wan04 ] . 
The SEM micrographs of wear debris of Al - 28Si - 5Cu - 4Mg alloys are shown in Fig . 5 . 
The wear debris of as - cast alloy is shown in Fig . 5 ( a ) and that of spray formed and hot pressed alloy is shown in Fig . 5 ( b ) . 
Close observation of the micrographs reveals that the size of debris particles of as - cast alloy is bigger than that of spray formed and hot pressed alloy . 
The as - cast alloy consists of large flakes and bigger debris particles where as spray formed and hot pressed alloy consists of smaller flakes and fine debris particles . 
The size of wear debris particle was found to be related to the applied load and the hardness of the material [ Ana10 ] . 
Since the hardness of spray formed and hot pressed alloy is higher than that of as - cast alloy , the size of its debris particles is smaller than that of as - cast alloy . 
The smaller size of the debris particles indicates that the wear rate of spray formed and hot pressed alloy is lower than that of as - cast alloy [ Esh11 ] . 
The following conclusions may be drawn from the present investigation on the spray forming and hot pressing of Al - 28Si - 5Cu - 4Mg alloy . The microstructure of spray formed and hot pressed alloy consists of fine and uniform distribution of both primary and eutectic Si with fine needles of Q - Al12Si7Mg4Fe intermetallics and Chinese script like θ - Al2Cu precipitates in the Al - matrix . Hot pressing has reduced the porosity from 10 to 1 % in spray formed alloy . The hardness of spray formed and hot pressed alloy is 142 VHN and that of as - cast alloy is 82 VHN . The wear resistance of spray formed and hot pressed alloy is higher than that of the as - cast alloy . The worn surface is less damaged and the debris particles are smaller in spray formed and hot pressed alloy compared to that in the as - cast alloy . 
Title : Load Relaxation and Creep Behavior of a Spray Cast Hypereutectic Al - 25Si - 2Cu - 1Mg Alloy 
We studied the high temperature deformation behavior of a spray cast Al - 25Si - 2Cu - 1Mg alloy within the framework of an internal variable theory for inelastic deformation . 
We then carried out a series of load relaxation tests at elevated temperatures to obtain flow curves between flow stress and strain rate . 
The results were analyzed based on constitutive relations prescribed by an internal variable theory . 
The hypereutectic Al - 25Si2Cu - 1Mg alloy exhibited two distinctly different deformation modes , viz . plastic deformation induced by dislocation glides and creep deformation by dislocation climbs at high temperatures . 
These load relaxation test results were then compared with those obtained from a series of creep tests performed at elevated temperatures under various stress levels . 
They were found to agree well with each other , providing a means to replace the time - consuming creep test by a simple load relaxation test in order to obtain high temperature creep data . 
An internal variable theory has been proposed based on dislocation dynamics to provide a more comprehensive understanding of inelastic deformation behavior . 
Dislocations are now well known to glide on slip planes in response to applied stress until they are blocked by strong barriers such as grain boundaries in order to produce internal strain energy . 
This strain energy due to accumulated dislocations could then be reduced through various slip transfer mechanisms [ 9 , 10 ] . 
Non - recoverable plastic strain rate ( α · ) was then viewed in the theory due to the relaxation of internal strain energy through the passage of glide dislocations to grain boundaries . 
In this way , the theory essentially views inelastic deformation as a simultaneous process of accumulation and relaxation of glide dislocations within slip zones and across strong barriers , respectively in order to produce an internal strain ( a ) and plastic strain rate ( α ) as prescribed in detail in the reference [ 9 ] . 
At elevated temperatures , additional relaxation processes can be operated to reduce accumulated internal strain energy , for example through a dislocation climb around strong barriers such as grain boundaries to generate a creep strain rate ( β · ) [ 10 , 12 ] . 
The time rate of change ≈ denotes a co - rotational material time derivative of internal strain tensor ( a ) , similar to that prescribed earlier by Hart [ 11 ] . 
This internal strain rate a ° due to accumulated glide dislocations within active slip zones could generally be neglected if the load relaxation tests were performed uniaxially under a steady state . 
The stresses required for dislocation glides have been well recognized to consist of the friction stress ( σ ) required to overcome the short - range interaction force between glide dislocation and lattice and the internal stress ( σ ) required to overcome the long - range interaction force among gliding dislocations to gives [ 9 ] , A physical as well as a rheological model could then be constructed by identifying the conjugate relationship among the various internal state variables . 
The results are schematically presented in Fig . 1 . 
Constitutive relations of plastic strain rate ( α ) and creep strain rate ( β ) were then regarded as mechanical activation processes caused by internal stress to give , with P α and P β denoting the dislocation permeability parameters , σ α ∗ and α ∗ an internal strength and its conjugate reference strain rate for plastic deformation , and σ β * and β · ∗ an internal strength and its conjugate reference strain rate for creep deformation [ 12 , 13 ] . 
The temperature dependence of α ∗ and β · ∗ were next prescribed in a classical Arrhenius type relation as , with f denoting jump frequency , µ shear modulus , n scaling parameter , and Q activation energy for each corresponding deformation mechanism . 
The activation energies for dislocation glide and dislocation climb can then be prescribed precisely by differentiating Eqns . 
5 and 6 after taking the natural logarithm of both sides as , with R now representing the gas constant . 
The constitutive relation between σ and ε · was next regarded as a viscous flow process due to frictional drag of lattice in the theory , but this stress is relatively small compared to internal stress at elevated temperatures . 
The friction stress is therefore irrelevant to the present study . 
The complete details of theoretical development and the definition of constitutive parameters can be found in referred articles [ 14 - 16 ] . 
The hypereutectic Al - 25 . 0Si - 2 . 0Cu - 1 . 0Mg ( wt . % ) alloy used in this study was produced by an ‘ OSPREY ’ spray casting process , which generally produces various sizes , morphologies and distributions of the primary Si particles in the Al matrix [ 16 ] . 
The typical microstructure of an as - cast alloy is shown in Fig . 2 , exhibiting Si particles with an average size of ~ 5 µ m distributed uniformly in a soft Al - matrix . The alloying elements Cu and Mg were added to improve mechanical properties , especially strengthening the alloy through precipitation hardening . 
Rectangular specimens used in this study were prepared from cylindrical billets and dimensions of 15 mm gauge length with a 5 × 3 mm crosssection area . 
A series of load relaxation tests was then performed using a hard - type mechanical testing machine [ an Instron model No . 8862 ] attached with a 3 - zone electric furnace capable of controlling test temperature within ± 0 . 5 ° C at elevated temperatures ranging from 200 to 500 . 
In the load relaxation tests , a specimen was first loaded in tension to a certain predetermined tensile strain before stopping the crosshead motion . 
Relaxation of the load was then monitored on a realtime basis to store the values of the load in a stand - alone PC . The flow curves in terms of stress and strain rate ( ε · ) were then constructed from the load data , viz . 
P - t curve utilizing the relations prescribed earlier by Lee and Hart [ 18 ] . 
This load relaxation test can , in general , provide a much wider range of strain rates with a minimal plastic straining , so that the flow curves can be regarded as constant structure curves corresponding to the relations given in Eqs . 
3 and 4 . 
Creep tests have also been conducted at temperatures ranging from 300 to 500 to compare with the results obtained from load relaxation tests . 
Creep tests were performed using a creep test machine designed to maintain the condition of constant stress through an air pressure . 
The strain developed during creep tests under a fixed stress was continuously recorded again on a real - time basis using a linear variable differential transformer and consequently used to determine the minimum creep strain rate . 
Flow stress vs . strain rate curves obtained from load relaxation tests at various elevated temperatures are plotted in Fig . 3 in a double log scale to reveal the general trend of shifting the curves to lower stress and higher strain rate region with an increase in test temperature from 200 to 500 . 
In addition , a distinct transition behavior can also be observed at low strain rates for the flow curves above 300 accompanied by a rapid drop in flow stress , a clear indication of a different deformation mechanism activated under lower stresses . These flow curves were then analyzed based on an internal variable theory as prescribed earlier and a typical result for 400 is given in Fig . 4 . 
Solid and broken lines in the figure represent the predicted curves for α and β · prescribed by Eqs . 
3 and 4 , respectively , to exhibit excellent agreement with the experimental data . 
The flow stress - strain rate curves could be resolved in this way into the two independent flow curves of ( α − σ ) and ( β − σ ) representing plasticity due to dislocation glide and creep due to dislocation climb , respectively . 
Transition in flow curves observed at temperatures above 300 is therefore thought to be due to activation of the dislocation climb process under lower stresses . 
The values of the constitutive parameters determined from these flow curve analyses based on an internal variable theory are listed in Table 1 . 
It should be noted here that the dislocation permeability parameters P α and P β were found to have a constant value of 0 . 15 regardless of test temperatures , as expected from previous reports [ 9 , 14 , 15 ] . 
The internal strength parameters σ * α and σ * β were identified to represent the strength of strong barriers such as grain boundaries in crystalline materials can be seen to decrease , while their conjugate reference strain rates α * and β · * increased with increasing test temperature . 
The logarithm values of α * and β · * given in Table 1 are plotted in terms of ( 1 / T ) in Fig . 5 to determine the activation energies as prescribed in Eqs . 
7 and 8 . The activation energies were determined from the slopes as 93 KJ / mol and 145 KJ / mol for the dislocation glide and the dislocation climb , respectively . 
Creep tests were also performed at elevated temperatures to compare with the results of load relaxation tests . The applied stresses for constant stress creep tests were found to correspond with the region for dislocation glide and dislocation climb observed in a load relaxation test for direct comparison purposes . 
The minimum creep strain rates are plotted as a function of applied stresses in Fig . 6 exhibiting the general trend of faster creep rate at higher temperature . 
In addition , the slope of minimum creep rate vs . applied stress can be seen clearly from the figure to change from a higher stress region to lower stress region , providing two separate values of power index n in the power law relation between stress and creep rate . 
This result appears to suggest the existence of two different deformation mechanisms , viz . 
a low stress regime controlled by dislocation climb having the stress exponent value close to n = 5 and the high stress regime controlled by dislocation glide with the stress exponent value close to n = 3 as shown in Fig . 6 . 
The activation energies for dislocation glide and dislocation climb can also be obtained by plotting again the logarithm of normalized minimum creep rates in terms of ( 1 / T ) as shown in Fig . 7 to give 85 KJ / mol and 137 KJ / mol in the high and low stress regions , respectively . 
These activation energies are very similar to the one of 90 KJ / mol for grain boundary diffusion in Al and the one of 140 KJ / mol for lattice self diffusion as reported earlier [ 19 - 21 ] . The change in the power index value n from n = 3 to n = 5 together with the change in activation energy could be interpreted in relation to the transition of the deformation mechanism from a viscous glide controlled by grain boundary diffusion in Al at a higher stress region to a climb controlled by lattice self - diffusion at a lower stress region [ 22 - 25 ] . 
The values of stresses and strain rates were then determined at the transition points from the flow curves from load relaxation tests and also from the minimum creep rate curves at each temperature , the results of which are listed in Table 2 . These transition stresses and strain rates are then plotted in Figs . 8 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively , to characterize early the change of deformation mechanism depending on stress level or strain rate . 
The transition stresses for both the load relaxation and creep tests were found to decrease rapidly as the test temperature was raised , while the transition strain rates to decrease slightly with test temperatures again for both cases . 
An additional deformation behavior due to dislocation climb seems to activate under lower stresses above 300 in this spray cast a hypereutectic Al - 25Si - 2Cu - 1Mg alloy , in addition to the usual plastic deformation observed under a relatively higher stress region . 
This observation then suggests that load relaxation tests can effectively provide data consistent with the ones obtained from time - consuming creep tests , especially for this alloy . 
This study investigated high temperature deformation behavior of a spray cast hypereutectic Al - 25Si - 2Cu - 1Mg alloy by applying an internal variable theory at elevated temperatures . 
Creep tests were also performed and the results were compared with those obtained from load relaxation tests . 
Some of the important results are obtained as follows ; 
( 1 ) The flow stress - strain rate curves obtained from load relaxation tests were found to consist of two separate flow curves of ( α − σ I ) and ( β − σ I ) due to dislocation glide and dislocation climb , respectively , based on internal variable theory . 
( 2 ) The minimum creep rates were found to increase slightly with rising test temperatures , while the creep stresses were found to reduce rapidly with temperature increases . 
This was consistent with the relaxation test results . 
( 3 ) The activation energies of hypereutectic Al - 25Si - 2Cu1 Mg alloy were obtained as 93 KJ / mol and 145 KJ / mol for dislocation glides and climbs , respectively , from load relaxation tests . 
Creep tests provided also the activation energies as 85 KJ / mol and 137 KJ / mol in higher and lower stress regions , respectively , closely matching the relaxation tests . 
( 4 ) Load relaxation test results were found to match well with the creep test results to suggest an effective means of replacing time consuming creep tests by a much simpler load relaxation test for the present spray cast hypereutectic Al25Si - 2Cu - 1Mg alloy . 
Title : Study on the preparation of the SiCp / Al – 20Si – 3Cu functionally graded material using spray deposition 
The SiCp / Al – 20Si – 3Cu functionally gradient material ( FGMs ) was successfully prepared via the spray deposition technique accompanied with an automatic control system . 
The results reveal that the SiCp weight fraction of the as - deposited preform from the top to the bottom ranges almost continuously from 0 % to 30 % . 
The part with the higher SiCp weight fraction exhibits a relatively smaller density than that with the lower SiCp weight fraction . 
However , the microhardness and the porosity increase with the increasing SiCp weight fraction in the as - deposited preform . 
The X - ray diffraction results exhibit that the secondary phases in the regions with the different amount of SiC particles are the same such as Al2Cu and AlCuMg . 
The spray deposition technology is promising to produce a wide range of other FGMs . 
In this study , the modi ﬁ ed Al – 20Si – 3Cu alloy is selected as the matrix since it exhibits good ﬂ ow ability , excellent strength and favourable wear resistance . 
The nominal chemical compositions ( in wt . % ) of the matrix alloy are 20 % Si , 3 . 0 % Cu , 0 . 5 % Mg , 0 . 3 % Mn and balance Al . 
The silicon carbide particles ( a - SiCp ) are used as the reinforcement and the average size of the reinforcing phase is about 7 μ m . 
The aluminum ingots and the other alloying elements are properly cleaned using the abrasive paper to eliminate the surface impurities prior to melting . 
Then the cleaned raw materials are placed in a crucible set in a pit furnace and superheated to 950 ◦ C . The SiCp particles are preheated to 600 ◦ C for 120 min to improve the wettability [ 14 ] . 
As shown in Fig . 1 , the experimental setup is composed of three units , i . e . the spray deposition unit , the conveyance unit of ceramic particles and the automatic control unit . 
The spray deposition part is the relatively conventional equipment , while the other two parts are the novel devices which play an important role in adjusting the output of SiCp to prepare the FGMs . 
Firstly , the pretreated SiCp particles are put into the feeder ( 21 ) and the alloy melt is imported into the crucible ( 11 ) simultaneously . 
The melt ﬂ ows through a graphite tube and is atomized by the inert gas . 
The ceramic particles are then imported to the venturi ( 26 ) through the impeller ( 23 ) driven by the speed motor ( 24 ) in a high pressure gas channel ( 25 ) when the speed motor ( 24 ) goes into operation . 
The high pressure inert gas goes through the ﬂ ow valve ( 27 ) into the venturi and produces negative pressure which can inhale the SiC particles and ﬁ nally generate a solid - gas dual medium in the vent of the venturi . 
The solid - gas dual medium reaches the injection port of the gunjet ( 12 ) and disperses the ceramic particles into ﬁ ne melt droplets ( 13 ) . 
The atomized droplets are deposited onto the substrate ( 15 ) positioned at an appropriate distance from the nozzle . The substrate is ﬁ xed on a lifting system ( 16 ) which can adjust the height so as to ensure that the distance is constant between the ingot surface and the nozzle during the whole spraying process . 
During the process , the rotary encoder ( 31 ) gathers the data of the speed and the working hours of the drive motor ( 32 ) and then converts them to the height information of the preform . 
Finally , these data are sent to the programmable logic controller ( PLC ) ( 33 ) . 
The PLC is connected to a computer ( 34 ) which is used to control the speed of the impeller motor ( 24 ) and thus the adjustment of the SiCp weight in real time is feasible . 
The technical parameters for the spray deposition process are listed in Table 1 . 
The as - deposited preform is sectioned into the discs with 30 mm in thickness along the deposition direction using the electrical discharge cutting machine for microstructural characterization and microhardness testing . 
The weight fraction of the SiC particles is quantitatively assessed by the chemical dissolution method . 
It can be expressed by the ratio of wp to wt , where wt and wp are the weight of the sample and that of the SiC particles respectively . 
The sample is dissolved in the hydrochloric acid until the matrix is completely disappeared , and then the SiC particles are ﬁ ltered from the distilled water , dried and weighed ( wp ) . 
Microstructural characterization is carried out using the metallographic microscopy with the help of optical microscope ( OM ) and the scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) on the polished samples and is aimed to investigate the distribution of the SiC particles and the interfacial integrity between the matrix and the SiC particles . 
The density of the as - deposited composite sample is measured according to the Archimedes principle . 
The density measurement involves weighing the polished cube ( 10 mm × 10 mm × 10 mm ) in air ( wa ) and that immersed in the distilled water ( ww ) . 
The measured density ρ m is calculated by wa ρ H2O / ( wa − ww ) . 
The porosity volume is obtained by 1 − ρ m / ρ t , while ρ m and ρ t are the measured density the theoretical density respectively . 
The samples are weighed using a FA1004 electronic balance with the accuracy of ± 0 . 0001 g . 
Microhardness testing is conducted on the MHV - 2000 digital microhardness tester . 
A pyramidal diamond indenter with a facing angle of 136 ◦ , the indenting load of 4 . 903N and the loading dwell time of 15s are adopted . 
The regions in the metal matrix and away from the porosities and the reinforcing SiC particles are selected for hardness indentation . 
The X - ray diffraction is conducted on a D - 5000 fully automatic X - ray diffractometer using the Cu Ka radiation . 
The X - ray diffraction patterns with the diffraction angle ( 2 θ ) range between 10 ◦ and 90 ◦ are obtained for phase identi ﬁ cation . 
The SiCp / Al – 20Si – 3Cu functionally gradient material is successfully prepared via the spray deposition process . 
As shown in Fig . 2a , the cylindrical preform with 240 mm in diameter and 280 mm in thickness is spray - deposited . 
Its surface is porous and the shrink - age is visible on the top face . 
The porosity can be attributed to the washout effect of the high pressure gas during the process . 
As shown in Fig . 2b , the surface layer of the as - deposited preform is removed by machine tooling and the cylindrical sample with 220 mm in diameter and 250 mm in thickness is obtained . 
The deposition rate is 44 . 56 g / s . 
The results indicate that spray deposition has the feasibility in the preparation of the FGMs . 
In comparison with conventional casting , spray deposition processing is relatively simple ( no stirring in the melt for the uniform dispersion of the particles ) and has the ability in producing large parts . 
For the entire processing , the supply system of the SiC particles is the key factor . 
The automatic control unit is designed to obtain the solid - gas dual medium ﬂ ow of the graded SiC particles . 
At the beginning of the processing , the speed of the impeller is zero and there is no output of the SiC particles . 
Then , the speed of the impeller increases gradually from 0 to 300 rpm , indicating that the output speed of the SiC particles ranges from 0 to 15 g / s . 
The relationship of the conveyance speed of the SiC particles against the motor speed is shown in Fig . 3 . 
The scattered points are experimental data . 
The input weight of the SiC particles exhibits a linear relationship with the impeller speed . 
The line in Fig . 3 is derived as a linear regression from the scattered values . 
All the results indicate that spray deposition is a reliable approach in producing the FGMs . 
The distribution of SiC particles in the as - deposited preform along the longitudinal direction is shown in Fig . 4 . 
The weight fraction of SiC particles in the as - deposited preform increases from the bottom to the top , which can be attributed to the different speed of the impeller controlled by the computer . 
The micrographs of the different regions in the preform are shown in Fig . 5 . 
No macroscopical defects are observed at the bottom where the SiC fraction is low . 
However , as the fraction of SiC particles increases , porosity also increases . 
Layered strips accompanied with pores are observed in the 60 mm regions from the top of the preform . 
The micrographs indicate that the volume fraction of SiC particles decreases gradually from the top to the bottom . 
In addition , the distribution of SiC particles is fairly uniform in each cross - section along the longitudinal direction . 
To further understand the distribution characteristics of SiC particles in the FGM , samples are sectioned from the preform at a distance of 60 and 210 mm from the bottom respectively and their fractured surfaces are also examined by SEM . 
As shown in Fig . 6 , the interface between the SiC particles and the matrix exhibits a good bonding in the area with the uniform distribution of SiC particles . 
As shown in Fig . 6a , no visible microvoids are detected at the interface between the SiC particles and the matrix . 
Most particles are impinged into the droplets , which are chilled during the spray deposition processing . 
The SiC particles are packed by the matrix alloy and no obvious interfacial reaction is observed . 
However , the bridging phenomenon of SiC particles exists , which is indicated by Fig . 6b . 
In addition , the more severe clustering tendency is also observed at the top of the pre - form than the bottom . 
The samples of 40 , 150 and 210 mm away from the bottom are studied . 
As shown in Fig . 7 , the porosity is visible . 
As indicated in Figs . 5 and 7 , the volume of the porosity increases with the increasing distance from the position to the basal body , along with the weight fraction of SiC particles . Moreover , the pores are mostly irregular in shape , which is ascribed to several factors . 
During the spray deposition processing , addition of higher amount of the SiC particles results in the clustering of particles and the entrapping of gas bubbles . 
Both can lead to the bridging of particles and thus liquid aluminum is dif ﬁ cult to ﬁ ll the spaces among them . 
The particles are packed to each other and corners are formed among them . 
Since the wettability between the SiC particles and aluminum is poor , the in ﬁ ltration of the alloy melt into the crevices among the particles is confronted with great dif ﬁ culties . 
Furthermore , the gas remained in the holes that prevent the ﬁ lling of the melt to maintain a steady pressure . 
The above results are in good consistency with those of the other researchers in this ﬁ eld [ 15 , 16 ] . 
Samples with the SiCp fraction of 15 % , 10 % and 5 % respectively are taken from the preform and the XRD analysis is conducted to investigate the phase constitutions of the layers with the different SiC addition . 
As shown in Fig . 8 , Al2Cu and AlCuMg are detected in all the samples . 
As shown in Figs . 5 and 7 , the primary silicon is ﬁ ne , dispersed and particle - like . 
The as - deposited SiCp / Al – 20Si – 3Cu functionally gradient material is composed of the Al matrix , the particle - like primary Si phase , SiC particles and the intermetallics mentioned above . 
The fraction of SiC particles has no obvious in ﬂ uence on the phase constitutions of the FGM and thus the subsequent densi ﬁ cation processing is possible . 
The density and the porosity versus the longitudinal distance from the bottom in the as - deposited Al – 20Si – 3Cu / SiCp FGM are shown in Fig . 9 . 
As seen from Fig . 9 , the density decreases with the increasing distance from the position to the bottom but the porosity increases . 
The latter is related to the increasing weight fraction of SiC particles from the bottom to the top . 
As shown in Fig . 9 , the calculated porosity is consistent with the results of micrographs . 
Although the density of SiC particles is greater than that of the Al – 20Si – 3Cu alloy , it is rational that the section with a higher weight fraction of SiC particles has a relatively lower density owing to the increasing porosity . 
The microhardness versus the longitudinal distance from the bottom in the as - deposited Al – 20Si – 3Cu / SiCp FGM is shown in Fig . 10 . 
Obviously , the matrix in the region with a higher fraction of SiC particles exhibits a higher microhardness value along the deposition direction . 
It is consistent with the fundamental mechanism responsible for strengthening of the metallic matrix by the reinforcing SiC particles . 
The presence of the stronger and stiffer SiC particles leads to the additional constraint to the localized plastic deformation of the matrix during the microhardness testing . Moreover , the considerable difference in the thermal expansion coef ﬁ cient between aluminum alloy and SiC contributes to the higher dislocation density in the matrix and thus brings about the hardening of the matrix . 
It has been reported that the dislocation density in the composite increases with the increasing fraction of the ceramic reinforcing particles [ 15 ] . 
Due to the presence of the porosity , the as - deposited Al – 20Si – 3Cu / SiCp FGM exhibits the inferior mechanical properties , indicating densi ﬁ cation is requisite before it is put into practical applications . 
The detailed investigation on the densi ﬁ cation process and mechanical properties of the Al – 20Si – 3Cu / SiCp FGM is underway . 
The spray deposition technique accompanied with an automatic control system for the adjustment of the output of SiC particles can be successfully used to prepare the bulk Al – 20Si – 3Cu / SiCp functionally gradient material . 
The microstructure of the spray - deposited SiCp / Al – 20Si – 3Cu functionally gradient material is composed of the Al matrix , the particle - like primary Si , SiC particles and the intermetallics such as Al2 Cu and AlCuMg . 
The fraction of SiC particles has no obvious in ﬂ uence on the phase constitutions of the FGM . 
The weight fraction of SiC particles in the as - deposited preform from the top to the bottom ranges almost continuously from 0 % to 30 % and their distribution is fairly uniform in each cross - section along the longitudinal direction . 
The microhardness and the porosity increase with the increasing SiCp weight fraction in the as - deposited preform , while the density is opposite . 
Title : Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Spray - Deposited Al - 17Si - 4 . 5Cu - 0 . 6Mg Wrought Alloy 
High Si content in AI - Si alloys usually leads to the formation of coarse , brittle Si phase under slow solidification conditions . 
In the present study , an AI - 17Si - 4 . 5Cu - 0 . 6Mg ( referred to hereafter as ASI7 ) was synthesized using spray deposition to modify the Si phase . 
In the spray deposition process , the master alloy of ASI7 was atomized using N2 gas , and was deposited on a collecting substrate directly into a three - dimensional material . 
The microstructure and mechanical behavior of the spray - deposited ASI7 were studied using optical microscopy ( OM ) scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , X - ray diffraction , and tensile tests . 
The present results indicate that in the spray - deposited AS17 , the eutectic Si phase was modified from a " flakelike " morphology , characteristic of ingot metallurgy ( IM ) materials , into a " particulate " morphology . 
The formation of the coarse primary Si blocks was suppressed . 
Moreover , the size and morphology of Si particulates were found to have significant influences on the deformation behavior . 
During plastic deformation , extensive fracture of Si occurred . 
The percentage of fractured Si increased with the increasing amount of plastic deformation and the size of Si particulates . 
Finally , the room - temperature mechanical properties of the spray - deposited AS17 were compared with its IM counterpart A390 ( an IM alloy with identical composition as AS17 ) . 
The strength and ductility of AS17 were improved over those of A390 . 
In the T6 condition , the yield strength and tensile elongation of AS17 were 503 MPa and 3 . 0 pct , respectively , whereas those of A390 were 374 MPa and 1 . 3 pct , respectively . 
The starting material used in the present investigation was commercial quality A390 , with nominal composition ( in weight percent ) AI - 17Si - 4 . 5Cu - 0 . 6Mg , and was provided by Reynolds Metals Company ( Richmond , VA ) in the form of ingot bars . 
In view of the fact that the A390 alloy designation refers to a casting composition , AS17 will be used herein to describe the spray - deposited and thermomechanically processed wrought alloy of the identical composition as A390 . 
Bulk , rapidly solidified AS17 samples were prepared utilizing a spray atomization and deposition approach . The spray - deposition experiments were conducted in an environmental chamber according to the following procedure . 
First , the alloy was superheated to a temperature of 1073 K in a graphite crucible under N2 gas at 1 atm pressure . 
Second , the superheated alloy melt was delivered to an atomizer through a ceramic delivery tube , where it was disintegrated into a fine dispersion of micrometersized droplets using nitrogen gas at a dynamic pressure of 3 . 1 MPa . 
Following atomization , the partially solidified droplets were collected on a hydraulically controlled , water - cooled , rotating Cu substrate , positioned at a distance of 46 cm from the atomizer . 
To maintain the atomizer - substrate distance at a constant value , the substrate was displaced vertically during the experiments . 
A summary of the primary processing parameters used in the present study is provided in Table I . 
The selection of the atomizer - substrate distance and other processing parameters used in the present investigation was prompted by experimental and numerical results presented elsewhere , suggesting that at this flight distance , the distribution of atomized droplets is comprised of both liquid and solid phases . 
Using the aforementioned procedure , spray - deposited materials of approximately 5 kg were prepared for the present investigation . 
Following the spray deposition experiments , the asspray - deposited materials were sectioned into billets 2 . 54 - cm diameter x 8 - cm long and were hot - extruded at temperatures between 623 and 773 K . 
Two extrusion ratios were selected , namely , 4 : 1 and 16 : 1 , corresponding to final sample diameters of 1 . 27 and 0 . 64 cm , respectively . 
Hot extrusion was used to close the micrometer - sized porosity normally associated with sprayatomized and spray - deposited materials . 
Immediately following extrusion , the extruded bars were subjected to air cooling . 
The cooling rate was estimated at 230 K / min . 
The microstructure of the spray - deposited and hotextruded materials was characterized using optical microscopy ( OM ) , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , and X - ray diffraction . 
The OM samples were prepared using standard metallographic techniques and were etched using the Keller ' s reagent . 
The size and size distribution of Si particulates and the grain size of the A1 matrix were determined using image analysis . 
The TEM thin foils were prepared using cold - stage argon ion milling in a Maxmill TM200 ion - milling device . 
The ion current and acceleration voltage were 20 μ A and 5 kV , respectively . 
The primary phases that are present were identified using both TEM selected area diffraction ( SAD ) and X - ray diffraction . 
The TEM studies were conducted on a PHILIPS * CM20 transmission electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 keV . 
The X - ray diffraction experiments were performed on a SIEMENS * * D5000 diffractometer using Cu - K α radiation . 
For phase identification , X - ray diffraction patterns were obtained in the diffraction angle ( 2 θ ) range between 20 and 90 deg . 
The supersaturation of alloying elements was determined using X - ray lattice parameter measurements . 
To that effect , the high - angle diffraction peaks of A1 ( 400 ) , ( 331 ) , and ( 422 ) were used to determine the lattice parameter . 
Finally , to provide insight into the deformation behavior of the alloy , the fracture surfaces of samples were analyzed using a Hitachi - S - 500 scanning electron microscope operating at 15 kV . 
Tensile tests were conducted on samples with two basic types of geometries : smooth cylindrical bars and flat plates . 
The flat sample geometry was used to determine the mechanical properties of the as - spray - deposited material . 
Particular emphasis was placed on assessing any variations in mechanical properties with the location of sampling within the spray - deposited materials ( i . e . , distance from substrate / deposited material interface ) . 
The gage section of the flat samples used was 2 . 5 x 4 . 0 x 16 . 0 mm . 
The smooth cylindrical samples were used to determine both room - and elevated - temperature properties of the spray - deposited and hot - extruded materials . The gage section of the cylindrical bar samples used was 4 . 0 - mm diameter x 16 . 0 - mm long . 
The room - and elevated - temperature tensile tests were conducted according to ASTM E8 - 81 in an Instron tensile testing machine at an initial strain rate of 3 x 10 - ^ 3 s - ^ 1 . The elevated - temperature tensile tests were conducted at 423 K at the same initial strain rate . 
To study the effect of grain size and the size of Si particulates on the mechanical behavior , the spray - deposited materials extruded at 673 K were subjected to isothermal heat treatment to change the grain size of the A1 matrix and the size of Si . 
The thermal history of the materials from spray deposition to isothermal heat treatment is illustrated schematically in Figure 1 . 
Figure 2 compares the microstructure of the as - spraydeposited ASI7 with that of the as - cast A390 alloy . 
In the as - cast condition , the microstructure of A390 consisted of blocklike Si particulates and eutectic A1 - Si phase . In the eutectic phase , Si exhibited a flakelike morphology with a large aspect ratio . 
Except for the Si phase , a small amount of secondary phases was also observed at the interdendritic boundaries . 
This is evidenced by the bright - field TEM micrographs shown in Figure 3 , which reveal the presence of secondary phases along interdendritic boundaries of the a - A1 phase . 
Two phases were identified using electron diffraction , namely , A12Cu and A1CuMg . 
With the exception of what appeared to be a chill zone of approximately 1 cm in thickness in the vicinity of the substrate , the microstructure of spray - deposited ASI7 was comprised of a distribution of dispersoids and equiaxed grains with an average grain size of 12 . 5 μ m . 
The dispersoids are shown in Figure 2 ( c ) from the polished surface of an as - spray - deposited sample , whereas the equiaxed grains are shown in Figure 2 ( d ) from the polished and etched surface of the same sample . 
As evident from the micrographs shown in Figure 2 , the dispersoids present in the α - A1 matrix of the as - spray - deposited ASI7 exhibited a faceted , particulate morphology ( Figures 2 ( c ) and ( d ) ) . 
A notable feature from Figures 2 ( c ) and ( d ) is the absence of regular eutectic AI - Si phase and primary Si blocks . 
The dispersoids were identified to be Si particulates by the X - ray diffraction spectrums shown in Figure 4 . 
The volume fraction of Si dispersoids , determined using image analysis , was 19 . 7 vol pct . 
The presence of particulate - shaped Si dispersoids has also been reported by other investigators in spray - deposited A1 - 12 wt pct Si . The equiaxed grain morphology noted in the present study is consistent with observations made by other investigators on spraydeposited materials . 
It is worth noting that a small volume fraction of other intermetallic phase particles was also observed in the microstructure of the spray - deposited AS17 that exhibited an irregular morphology . 
Figure 4 ( b ) shows the X - ray diffraction pattern of the material extruded at 673 K . 
From the X - ray diffraction data , the secondary phases that can be identified in the AS17 are the Si and the equilibrium A12Cu phases . 
Furthermore , TEM studies revealed the presence of an additional secondary phase not detected by X - ray diffraction . 
One example is shown in Figure 5 , which reveals that this phase primarily exhibited a spherical morphology . 
On the basis of the electron diffraction pattern shown in Figure 5 ( b ) , this phase was identified as A12CuMg . 
This observation agrees with the results of Zhou and Duszczyk , who reported the presence of A12CuMg in Cu and Mg containing hypereutectic A1 - Si alloys . 
The lattice parameters of A1 , as determined by X - ray diffraction , are summarized in Table II for the materials extruded at 773 and 623 K , respectively . 
The resuits indicate that the lattice parameters of the materials extruded at 623 and 773 K are both smaller than that of pure AI . 
The hot extrusion appeared to have reduced the average size of the Si dispersoids . 
Consistent with qualitative observations , results from image analysis revealed that the average size of the Si dispersoids decreased from 5 μ m in the as - spray - deposited material to 1 . 9 μ m in the material hot - extruded at 673 K to a reduction in area of 16 : 1 . 
Moreover , the microstructure of the material hotextruded at 673 K appeared to remain unrecrystallized . 
The microstructure of the extruded material , however , recrystallized during isothermal heat treatment at 773 K . 
The recrystallized microstructure was very similar to that of the as - spray - deposited material . 
A summary of the variation in average grain size and Si particulate size , with isothermal heating time at 773 K , is provided in Figure 6 . 
The coarsening of both Si dispersoids and grains followed a similar trend . 
The grain size of the A1 matrix and the size of Si particulates were also summarized in Table III . 
To study the effect of solidification conditions on the mechanical properties of the as - spray - deposited AS17 , the strength of as - spray - deposited materials was measured as a function of the location of samples within the spray - deposited preform ( i . e . , the distance from substrate / deposited material interface ) . 
The variations in yield and ultimate tensile strengths of as - spray - deposited AS17 with the distance from the deposition substrate are summarized in Figure 7 . 
The results shown in this figure suggest that , with the exception of the material in the vicinity of the cooling substrate , the mechanical properties of the as - spray - deposited material remained relatively independent of the specific sample location . 
The strength of materials in the vicinity of the cooling substrate was relatively low compared with those in the central portion of the spray - deposited preform . 
The strength of the as - spray - deposited AS17 was comparable to that of the IM A390 and rapidly solidified powder metallurgy ( RS PM ) AI - Si alloys . 
For example , the average yield strength of the as - spray - deposited AS17 is 218 MPa , whereas that of the A390 is 200 MPa in the permanent mold - cast condition , and 240 MPa in the die cast condition . 
It has been shown that the thermomechanical processing has a strong influence on the mechanical properties of RS - PM hypereutectic AI - Si alloys . 
However , for RS - PM alloys , the extrusion temperature has been studied only up to a temperature of 748 K , since at higher extrusion temperatures , the materials fracture during extrusion , presumably because of hot shortness . 
In addition , there is no information available on the effect of extrusion conditions on the properties of spray - deposited hypereutectic A1 - Si alloys . 
Therefore , in the present investigation , the spray - deposited ASI7 was extruded at various temperatures and extrusion ratios to study the effect of extrusion conditions on the mechanical properties , thereby establishing optimum extrusion conditions for further investigation . 
Figures 8 ( a ) and ( b ) show the variations in the room - temperature tensile properties with extrusion temperature for 4 : 1 and 16 : 1 area reduction ratios , respectively . 
The materials extruded with an extrusion ratio of 4 : 1 exhibited a relative low strength at intermediate extrusion temperatures . 
As shown in Figure 8 , the strength corresponding to materials extruded at 633 and 773 K are higher than those extruded at 673 and 723 K . 
The materials extruded using a 16 : 1 area reduction ratio exhibited a trend similar to that of those extruded using a 4 : 1 ratio , with the exception that the minimum strength of the former material occurred at 723 K . 
It is important to note that the integrity of the material extruded at 773 K using a 16 : 1 extrusion ratio was affected by hot shortness . 
Therefore , on the basis of the present results , it is evident that an extrusion temperature of 673 K and a 16 : 1 reduction ratio represent the optimal extrusion conditions . 
To study the influence of grain size of the A1 matrix and the size of Si dispersoids on the mechanical behavior of spray - deposited ASI7 , materials extruded at 673 K with an area reduction ratio of 16 : 1 were subsequently subjected to isothermal heat treatment at 773 K . 
The resuits of these studies , summarized in Figures 9 ( a ) and ( b ) , reveal a trend of decreasing strength with thermal exposure for a time period of up to 36 hours , immediately followed by an increase in strength with thermal exposure . 
The trend observed at 423 K was very similar to that observed at room temperature . 
The roomtemperature mechanical properties of the as - spraydeposited and heat - treated AS17 are also summarized in Table IV in comparison with those of the hypereutectic alloys of similar compositions but processed utilizing alternative processing techniques . 
It is evident from the results shown in Table IV that in the as - spray - deposited and the as - extruded conditions , the yield strength of spraydeposited ASI7 is lower than that of the RS RM AI - Si alloy but is generally higher than that of sand and permanent mold - cast A390 alloy . 
The elongation of the spraydeposited AS17 is , however , considerably higher than that of the cast A390 . 
The elongation of the spraydeposited alloy is in the range of 3 . 0 to 7 . 2 pct , whereas that of the IM A390 is generally less than 1 pct . 
For the purpose of comparison , the IM A390 was also extruded and heat treated . 
Following a T6 treatment , the strength of both A390 and spray - deposited AS17 was improved . 
However , in the T6 condition , the strength of spraydeposited AS17 was much higher than that of A390 , which had an identical chemical composition . 
Macroscop ~ cally , the fracture surface of spray - deposited and hot - extruded samples tested at room temperature was relatively flat , suggestive of brittle fracture . 
This is consistent with the results shown in Table IV , which show that the total elongation to fracture was generally less than 7 . 2 pct . 
With the exception of an increase in elongation , the spray - deposited and extruded material tested at 423 K exhibited a fracture morphology similar to that of equivalent material tested at room temperature . 
In contrast to the macroscopic appearance , the SEM fractographs shown in Figure 10 , which were taken from material fractured at room temperature , reveal a dimple type of fracture morphology . 
Close inspection of the fracture surface shows that microscopically the fracture surface exhibited both ductile and brittle fracture features . 
Whereas the matrix material in the edge regime of the dimples revealed extensive plasticity indicative of ductile fracture , that in the center of the dimples was relatively featureless , suggesting brittle fracture . 
This is supported by the fractographic surface features shown in Figure 10 ( b ) , which reveal the presence of secondary cracks in the center of the dimples . 
The macroscopically brittle , microscopically ductile fracture morphology observed in AS I7 closely resembles that of MMCs reinforced with ceramic particulates . 
It is worth noting that the size of the dimples is generally larger than the average size of the Si particulates . 
Moreover , the size of the dimples followed a linear relationship with that of the Si particulates ( Figure 11 ) . 
Energy - dispersive spectroscopy ( EDS ) analysis was performed on the fracture surfaces . 
The results indicate that the center of the dimples was rich in Si , whereas the edges were rich in AI . 
Figure 12 shows the EDS elemental maps taken from the fracture surface . 
It can be seen that the distribution of Si is nonuniform , being rich in the dimple center , while Cu is relatively uniformly distributed , suggestive of fracture of Si particulates during deformation . 
To investigate the behavior of the Si particulates during deformation and fracture , the heat - treated tensile test samples were polished and subsequently stretched at room temperature to various amounts of plastic strain . 
The stretched samples were examined using an optical microscope . 
The microstructure of such deformed samples is shown in Figure 13 . 
There are two important microstructural observations that may be deduced from Figure 13 . 
First , both debonding and fracture of the Si particulates occurred during plastic deformation . 
Second , coarse Si particulates appeared to fracture more frequently than fine Si particulates . 
The latter suggestion is supported by the statistical analysis of the size distribution of the fractured and the debonded Si particulates . 
As shown by the size distribution in Figure 14 , the average size of fractured and debonded Si particulates is much greater than that of the unfractured ( un - debonded ) ones . 
The fraction of fractured and debonded particulates was plotted as a function of the average particulate size , as shown in Figure 15 . 
The results presented herein show that the average size of fractured and debonded Si particulates increases with increasing average particulate size , suggestive of a stronger tendency toward particulate fracture and debonding with increasing particulate size ( Figure 15 ) . 
The two salient microstructural features present in asspray - deposited AS17 alloy are the particulate - like Si pfiase and the equiaxed grains . 
The regular eutectic AI - Si phase and primary Si blocks commonly associated with IM hypereutectic AI - Si alloys were suppressed . 
The presence of a fine dispersion of particulate - like Si phase has also been observed by other investigators working with RS PM hypereutectic AI - Si alloys . Although a detailed analysis of this phenomenon was not attempted , the presence of particulate - like Si dispersoids was attributed to the high cooling rate , on the order of 10 ^ 4 to 10 ^ 6 K s - ^ 1 , typically associated with RS PM processes . 
The origin bf the particulate - like Si dispersoids observed in spray - deposited AS17 is presently not well understood . 
The formation of particulate - like Si phase , however , may be attributed to three possible causes . 
First , the relatively high cooling rates present during deposition ( 2 . 0 to 4 . 6 x 10 ^ 3 K s - ^ 1 ) may effectively alter the morphological stability of the Si phase . 
Second , the repeated deformation and fracture experienced by the partially solidified droplets during deposition may effectively break the Si phase that formed prior to the deposition stage . 
The presence of such Si phase increases the nucleation kinetics of Si by increasing the number density of nuclei in the top layer of the spray - deposited material , thereby suppressing the formation of eutectic A1 - Si during deposition . 
Third , it is likely that the formation of the particulate - like Si phase is a result of the competition between nucleation and growth in front of the solid / liquid ( S / L ) interface in the top layer of the spray - deposited material . 
As discussed by Fabietti and Sekhar , when a concentration gradient is present in front of the S / L interface , the dendritic or planar growth front may be replaced by an equiaxed structure . 
In the case of AI - Si hypereutectic alloy , the Si growth front rejects A1 atoms into the liquid alloy . 
As a result , there is a local region of low Si concentration present in front of the S / L interface . 
This leads to a relatively low liquidus at the interfacial area . 
The liquidus temperature , however , increases with increasing distance from the interface as the concentration in the liquid phase approaches the bulk concentration of the alloy . 
When a positive thermal gradient is present , as in the case of spray deposition , a maximum undercooling will occur at some distance from the S / L interface . 
This suggestion is shown schematically in Figure 16 ( a ) . 
When the constitutional undercooling is large enough , new grains of Si may form in front of the S / L interface , resulting in the formation of particulate - like Si particles . 
The presence of an equiaxed grain morphology in the as - spray - deposited material agrees with the results of previous studies on spray - deposited unreinforced and reinforced materials of various compositions . There are two basic mechanisms proposed in the literature that can be used to explain this equiaxed grain morphology : equiaxed grain formation by dendrite arm fragmentation and equiaxed grain development by growth and coalescence of dendrite flagments during solid - state cooling . In the first mechanism 
( i . e . , dendrite ann fragmentation ) , dendrite arm fragments are considered to be the major cause for the formation of equiaxed grains . 
In correlating the observed equiaxed microstructure with the dynamic processes in spray deposition , Lavernia and co - workers and Annavarapu et al . suggest that , as a result of the incidence of solid , liquid , and semiliquid droplets , a semiliquid / semisolid layer develops on the deposition surface . 
The impact of solid and semisolid droplets on the deposition surface provides dendrite arm fragments , which may act as nucleation centers for equiaxed grains . 
Regarding the formation of equiaxed grains during solidstate cooling , Liang et al . propose that the equiaxed grains evolve from two distinct processes during solidstate cooling in Ni - base alloys : ( 1 ) the homogenization of dendrite arms that did not deform extensively during deposition and ( 2 ) the growth and coalescence of deformed and fractured dendrite arms . 
Support to this suggestion was provided by experimental and numerical results obtained on spray - deposited Ni3A1 , suggesting that the microstructure in the bulk spray - deposited Ni3A1 is exposed to a high - temperature thermal exposure in the deposition stage . 
In view of the low melting temperature of the present material , dendritic arm fragmentation is likely to be the mechanism that caused the formation of equiaxed grains . 
Moreover , in view of the hypereutectic composition of the present material , the Si particulates that form first from the melt may also enhance nucleation of A1 through an epitaxy growth mechanism . 
Inspection of the results summarized in Table IV reveals that the strength of as - spray - deposited AS17 is comparable to that of the die - cast A390 and is much higher than that of the sand and permanent mold - cast A390 , in spite of the fact that there is 1 . 5 to 2 . 4 vol pct porosity present in the former material . 
This observation is not totally surprising in view of the fact that during spray deposition , the material experienced nonequilibrium solidification conditions . 
The relatively high cooling rates and concomitant high interfacial velocities present during spray deposition are generally thought to be responsible for the presence of metastable solid solutions and other nonequilibrium microstructural characteristics often observed in spray - deposited materials . 
Gupta et al . , for example , reported the presence of a metastable solid solution in spray - deposited Al - 4 . 0 wt pct Ti , containing up to 0 . 88 wt pct Ti . 
In contrast , under equilibrium conditions , Ti exhibits negligible solubility in solid Al . 
The observed decrease in strength of AS17 , with increasing extrusion temperature , agrees with the results of Zhou and Duszczyk , who observed a general decrease in the strength of RSPM hypereutectic AI - Si alloys with increasing extrusion temperature , up to 748 K . 
This decrease in strength may be attributed to the increasing dynamic recovery with increasing extrusion temperature . 
The relatively high strength of the materials extruded at 773 K was unexpected and may be attributed to a solid - solution - strengthening effect . 
In fact , the AS17 alloy composition is known to have solution strengthening upon cooling from processing temperatures . Since the high cooling rate was experienced by the present material following extrusion , i . e . , 230 K / min , a solutionstrengthening effect is expected . 
Supersaturation of the A1 lattice in the present alloy was detected by X - ray lattice parameter measurements . 
As shown in Table II , the lattice parameter of the material extruded at 773 K is 0 . 032 pct less than that of the pure A1 . 
If the atomic size of Cu is considered , this lattice parameter decrease means a supersaturation of 1 . 0 wt pct . 
Supersaturation was confirmed by EDS analysis in the TEM thin films . 
The present EDS results indicate that the average concentration of Cu and Mg in the A1 matrix was 1 . 5 and 0 . 8 wt pct , respectively ' . 
Moreover , the Si concentration in the matrix was essentially less than the detection limit of EDS . 
Inspection of the results shown in Figure 6 suggests that thermal exposure of this material at 773 K for 110 hours resulted in growth of the Si particulates and grains . 
Surprisingly , the strength of spray - deposited and extruded AS I7 did not show a monotonic decrease with thermal exposure . 
As indicated by Figure 9 , the strength of the material isothermally treated at 773 K exhibited an initial decrease for a time period of less than 36 hours ; further annealing resulted in an increase in strength . 
Regarding the strengthening of ASI7 , there are several possible mechanisms that may be operative . 
These include texture effect , grain size effect , differential coefficient of thermal expansion ( Δ CTE ) , induced immobile dislocations , and load transfer from the matrix to the Si particulates . 
Regarding texture development in particulatereinforced materials , extensive work has been conducted in recent years . 
The results of these studies demonstrated that nondeformable particulates of a size greater than 0 . 1 μ m may alter texture formation significantly . Particulates may cause either deformation zones with " disperse " sharp texture components or stimulate localized nucleation of recrystallized grains at the particulatematrix interfaces . 
Both effects contribute to a texture that is almost random in these materials . 
In a recent study of particulate - reinforced A1 - Li metal - matrix composite ( MMC ) Przystupa et a1 . noted that the texture in the particulate - containing material is much weaker as compared with that of the unreinforced matrix . 
They attributed this effect to the absence of redundant shears in the presence of nondeformable particulates ( greater than 0 . 1 μ m ) . 
The present AS17 contains 19 . 8 vol pct of Si particulates in the size range of 2 . 5 to 6 . 1 μ m . 
Therefore , it is anticipated that the texture , if any , will be relatively random . 
In fact , isothermal heat treatment at high temperatures may increase this randomness . 
Accordingly , texture is unlikely to be responsible for the observed differences in strength with increasing isothermal heating time , as shown in Figure 9 . 
Alternatively , we consider the AI - Si alloy as a MMC , consisting of a soft A1 matrix with interdispersed Si particulates . 
A well - defined microstrnctural characteristic of MMCs that are reinforced with ceramic reinforcements is a high density of immobile dislocations . 
Arsenault and Shi and Vogelsang et al . , for example , conducted a series of direct TEM observations on A1 alloybase MMCs . 
Their results indicate that a dislocation density as high as l0 ^ 13 to 10 ^ 14 m - ^ 2 is present in the vicinity of the particulate / matrix interface . 
The origin of these immobile dislocations was attributed to the large difference in CTE between ceramic reinforcements and metal matrices . 
The Δ CTE - generated high dislocation density has been considered to be a major strengthening mechanism in discontinuously reinforced MMCs . 
In AI alloy - base MMCs , a commonly selected reinforcement is SiC . 
A comparison of the CTEs of AI , SiC , and Si indicates that the CTEs of AI and SiC are 23 . 2x10 - ^ 6 K - ^ 1 and 4 . 6x10 - ^ 6 K - ^ 1 , respectively , whereas that of Si is 2 . 5 x 10 - ^ 6 K - ^ 1 . 
Because the difference in CTE between A1 and Si is greater than that between AI and SiC , a higher dislocation density due to Δ CTE is expected in the former combination . 
Hence , in view of the large Δ CTE between A1 and Si , strengthening by immobile dislocations should be considered . 
Accordingly , the Si particulate / matrix interfaces were examined to reveal the presence of immobile dislocations . 
As an example , Figure 17 shows the TEM micrographs taken from the ASI7 alloy following 100 hours of isothermal heat treatment . 
The interface between Si and the matrix is well defined . 
Moreover , a high density of dislocations was present in the vicinity of the interface ( Figure 7 ( b ) ) . 
The dislocation density determined from the TEM observation is 1 . 1 x l0 ^ 14 m - ^ 2 , in agreement with the results of Arsenault et a1 . obtained on 1100 AI reinforced with 20 vol pct of SiC particulates ( 4 . 7 x 10 ^ 13 to 1 . 8 x 10 ^ 14 m - ^ 2 ) . 
The microstructure of as - spray - deposited AS17 is composed primarily of particulate - shaped Si phase and equiaxed grains , with the absence of regular eutectic AI - Si and primary Si blocks . 
The presence of these microstructural features was discussed in light of the relatively high cooling rate and nucleation kinetics present during atomization and deposition . In the as - spray - deposited condition , the strength of AS17 is comparable to that of the die - cast A390 alloy but is higher than that of sand and permanent moldcast A390 in spite of the presence of 1 . 5 to 2 . 4 vol pct porosity . 
Following a T6 treatment , the AS 17 exhibited a much higher strength than that of A390 . 
In the T6 condition , the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of the AS17 are 506 and 532 MPa , respectively . 
In contrast , the corresponding yield strength and ultimate strength of A390 are 374 and 387 MPa , respectively . 
In addition , the ductility of spraydeposited AS17 is generally improved over that of the A390 counterpart for the thermomechanical conditions studied herein . Elevated - temperature annealing at 773 K resulted in coarsening , of both grains and Si particulates . 
The strength of the heat - treated materials , however , exhibits an unusual behavior during microstructural coarsening . 
While the initial microstructural coarsening leads to a decrease in strength , prolonged thermal exposure leads to an increase in strength . 
This behavior was discussed in light of stress concentration at the Si / matrix interfaces and load transfer from the matrix alloy to the hard Si particulates during plastic deformation . 
Title : Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Spray - Deposited Al - 17Si - 4 . 5Cu - 0 . 6Mg Wrought Alloy 
High Si content in AI - Si alloys usually leads to the formation of coarse , brittle Si phase under slow solidification conditions . 
In the present study , an AI - 17Si - 4 . 5Cu - 0 . 6Mg ( referred to hereafter as ASI7 ) was synthesized using spray deposition to modify the Si phase . 
In the spray deposition process , the master alloy of ASI7 was atomized using N2 gas , and was deposited on a collecting substrate directly into a three - dimensional material . 
The microstructure and mechanical behavior of the spray - deposited ASI7 were studied using optical microscopy ( OM ) scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , X - ray diffraction , and tensile tests . 
The present results indicate that in the spray - deposited AS17 , the eutectic Si phase was modified from a " flakelike " morphology , characteristic of ingot metallurgy ( IM ) materials , into a " particulate " morphology . 
The formation of the coarse primary Si blocks was suppressed . 
Moreover , the size and morphology of Si particulates were found to have significant influences on the deformation behavior . 
During plastic deformation , extensive fracture of Si occurred . 
The percentage of fractured Si increased with the increasing amount of plastic deformation and the size of Si particulates . 
Finally , the room - temperature mechanical properties of the spray - deposited AS17 were compared with its IM counterpart A390 ( an IM alloy with identical composition as AS17 ) . 
The strength and ductility of AS17 were improved over those of A390 . 
In the T6 condition , the yield strength and tensile elongation of AS17 were 503 MPa and 3 . 0 pct , respectively , whereas those of A390 were 374 MPa and 1 . 3 pct , respectively . 
The starting material used in the present investigation was commercial quality A390 , with nominal composition ( in weight percent ) AI - 17Si - 4 . 5Cu - 0 . 6Mg , and was provided by Reynolds Metals Company ( Richmond , VA ) in the form of ingot bars . 
In view of the fact that the A390 alloy designation refers to a casting composition , AS17 will be used herein to describe the spray - deposited and thermomechanically processed wrought alloy of the identical composition as A390 . 
Bulk , rapidly solidified AS17 samples were prepared utilizing a spray atomization and deposition approach . The spray - deposition experiments were conducted in an environmental chamber according to the following procedure . 
First , the alloy was superheated to a temperature of 1073 K in a graphite crucible under N2 gas at 1 atm pressure . 
Second , the superheated alloy melt was delivered to an atomizer through a ceramic delivery tube , where it was disintegrated into a fine dispersion of micrometersized droplets using nitrogen gas at a dynamic pressure of 3 . 1 MPa . 
Following atomization , the partially solidified droplets were collected on a hydraulically controlled , water - cooled , rotating Cu substrate , positioned at a distance of 46 cm from the atomizer . 
To maintain the atomizer - substrate distance at a constant value , the substrate was displaced vertically during the experiments . 
A summary of the primary processing parameters used in the present study is provided in Table I . 
The selection of the atomizer - substrate distance and other processing parameters used in the present investigation was prompted by experimental and numerical results presented elsewhere , suggesting that at this flight distance , the distribution of atomized droplets is comprised of both liquid and solid phases . 
Using the aforementioned procedure , spray - deposited materials of approximately 5 kg were prepared for the present investigation . 
Following the spray deposition experiments , the asspray - deposited materials were sectioned into billets 2 . 54 - cm diameter x 8 - cm long and were hot - extruded at temperatures between 623 and 773 K . 
Two extrusion ratios were selected , namely , 4 : 1 and 16 : 1 , corresponding to final sample diameters of 1 . 27 and 0 . 64 cm , respectively . 
Hot extrusion was used to close the micrometer - sized porosity normally associated with sprayatomized and spray - deposited materials . 
Immediately following extrusion , the extruded bars were subjected to air cooling . 
The cooling rate was estimated at 230 K / min . 
The microstructure of the spray - deposited and hotextruded materials was characterized using optical microscopy ( OM ) , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , and X - ray diffraction . 
The OM samples were prepared using standard metallographic techniques and were etched using the Keller ' s reagent . 
The size and size distribution of Si particulates and the grain size of the A1 matrix were determined using image analysis . 
The TEM thin foils were prepared using cold - stage argon ion milling in a Maxmill TM200 ion - milling device . 
The ion current and acceleration voltage were 20 μ A and 5 kV , respectively . 
The primary phases that are present were identified using both TEM selected area diffraction ( SAD ) and X - ray diffraction . 
The TEM studies were conducted on a PHILIPS * CM20 transmission electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 keV . 
The X - ray diffraction experiments were performed on a SIEMENS * * D5000 diffractometer using Cu - K α radiation . 
For phase identification , X - ray diffraction patterns were obtained in the diffraction angle ( 2 θ ) range between 20 and 90 deg . 
The supersaturation of alloying elements was determined using X - ray lattice parameter measurements . 
To that effect , the high - angle diffraction peaks of A1 ( 400 ) , ( 331 ) , and ( 422 ) were used to determine the lattice parameter . 
Finally , to provide insight into the deformation behavior of the alloy , the fracture surfaces of samples were analyzed using a Hitachi - S - 500 scanning electron microscope operating at 15 kV . 
Tensile tests were conducted on samples with two basic types of geometries : smooth cylindrical bars and flat plates . 
The flat sample geometry was used to determine the mechanical properties of the as - spray - deposited material . 
Particular emphasis was placed on assessing any variations in mechanical properties with the location of sampling within the spray - deposited materials ( i . e . , distance from substrate / deposited material interface ) . 
The gage section of the flat samples used was 2 . 5 x 4 . 0 x 16 . 0 mm . 
The smooth cylindrical samples were used to determine both room - and elevated - temperature properties of the spray - deposited and hot - extruded materials . The gage section of the cylindrical bar samples used was 4 . 0 - mm diameter x 16 . 0 - mm long . 
The room - and elevated - temperature tensile tests were conducted according to ASTM E8 - 81 in an Instron tensile testing machine at an initial strain rate of 3 x 10 - ^ 3 s - ^ 1 . The elevated - temperature tensile tests were conducted at 423 K at the same initial strain rate . 
To study the effect of grain size and the size of Si particulates on the mechanical behavior , the spray - deposited materials extruded at 673 K were subjected to isothermal heat treatment to change the grain size of the A1 matrix and the size of Si . 
The thermal history of the materials from spray deposition to isothermal heat treatment is illustrated schematically in Figure 1 . 
Figure 2 compares the microstructure of the as - spraydeposited ASI7 with that of the as - cast A390 alloy . 
In the as - cast condition , the microstructure of A390 consisted of blocklike Si particulates and eutectic A1 - Si phase . In the eutectic phase , Si exhibited a flakelike morphology with a large aspect ratio . 
Except for the Si phase , a small amount of secondary phases was also observed at the interdendritic boundaries . 
This is evidenced by the bright - field TEM micrographs shown in Figure 3 , which reveal the presence of secondary phases along interdendritic boundaries of the a - A1 phase . 
Two phases were identified using electron diffraction , namely , A12Cu and A1CuMg . 
With the exception of what appeared to be a chill zone of approximately 1 cm in thickness in the vicinity of the substrate , the microstructure of spray - deposited ASI7 was comprised of a distribution of dispersoids and equiaxed grains with an average grain size of 12 . 5 μ m . 
The dispersoids are shown in Figure 2 ( c ) from the polished surface of an as - spray - deposited sample , whereas the equiaxed grains are shown in Figure 2 ( d ) from the polished and etched surface of the same sample . 
As evident from the micrographs shown in Figure 2 , the dispersoids present in the α - A1 matrix of the as - spray - deposited ASI7 exhibited a faceted , particulate morphology ( Figures 2 ( c ) and ( d ) ) . 
A notable feature from Figures 2 ( c ) and ( d ) is the absence of regular eutectic AI - Si phase and primary Si blocks . 
The dispersoids were identified to be Si particulates by the X - ray diffraction spectrums shown in Figure 4 . 
The volume fraction of Si dispersoids , determined using image analysis , was 19 . 7 vol pct . 
The presence of particulate - shaped Si dispersoids has also been reported by other investigators in spray - deposited A1 - 12 wt pct Si . The equiaxed grain morphology noted in the present study is consistent with observations made by other investigators on spraydeposited materials . 
It is worth noting that a small volume fraction of other intermetallic phase particles was also observed in the microstructure of the spray - deposited AS17 that exhibited an irregular morphology . 
Figure 4 ( b ) shows the X - ray diffraction pattern of the material extruded at 673 K . 
From the X - ray diffraction data , the secondary phases that can be identified in the AS17 are the Si and the equilibrium A12Cu phases . 
Furthermore , TEM studies revealed the presence of an additional secondary phase not detected by X - ray diffraction . 
One example is shown in Figure 5 , which reveals that this phase primarily exhibited a spherical morphology . 
On the basis of the electron diffraction pattern shown in Figure 5 ( b ) , this phase was identified as A12CuMg . 
This observation agrees with the results of Zhou and Duszczyk , who reported the presence of A12CuMg in Cu and Mg containing hypereutectic A1 - Si alloys . 
The lattice parameters of A1 , as determined by X - ray diffraction , are summarized in Table II for the materials extruded at 773 and 623 K , respectively . 
The resuits indicate that the lattice parameters of the materials extruded at 623 and 773 K are both smaller than that of pure AI . 
The hot extrusion appeared to have reduced the average size of the Si dispersoids . 
Consistent with qualitative observations , results from image analysis revealed that the average size of the Si dispersoids decreased from 5 μ m in the as - spray - deposited material to 1 . 9 μ m in the material hot - extruded at 673 K to a reduction in area of 16 : 1 . 
Moreover , the microstructure of the material hotextruded at 673 K appeared to remain unrecrystallized . 
The microstructure of the extruded material , however , recrystallized during isothermal heat treatment at 773 K . 
The recrystallized microstructure was very similar to that of the as - spray - deposited material . 
A summary of the variation in average grain size and Si particulate size , with isothermal heating time at 773 K , is provided in Figure 6 . 
The coarsening of both Si dispersoids and grains followed a similar trend . 
The grain size of the A1 matrix and the size of Si particulates were also summarized in Table III . 
To study the effect of solidification conditions on the mechanical properties of the as - spray - deposited AS17 , the strength of as - spray - deposited materials was measured as a function of the location of samples within the spray - deposited preform ( i . e . , the distance from substrate / deposited material interface ) . 
The variations in yield and ultimate tensile strengths of as - spray - deposited AS17 with the distance from the deposition substrate are summarized in Figure 7 . 
The results shown in this figure suggest that , with the exception of the material in the vicinity of the cooling substrate , the mechanical properties of the as - spray - deposited material remained relatively independent of the specific sample location . 
The strength of materials in the vicinity of the cooling substrate was relatively low compared with those in the central portion of the spray - deposited preform . 
The strength of the as - spray - deposited AS17 was comparable to that of the IM A390 and rapidly solidified powder metallurgy ( RS PM ) AI - Si alloys . 
For example , the average yield strength of the as - spray - deposited AS17 is 218 MPa , whereas that of the A390 is 200 MPa in the permanent mold - cast condition , and 240 MPa in the die cast condition . 
It has been shown that the thermomechanical processing has a strong influence on the mechanical properties of RS - PM hypereutectic AI - Si alloys . 
However , for RS - PM alloys , the extrusion temperature has been studied only up to a temperature of 748 K , since at higher extrusion temperatures , the materials fracture during extrusion , presumably because of hot shortness . 
In addition , there is no information available on the effect of extrusion conditions on the properties of spray - deposited hypereutectic A1 - Si alloys . 
Therefore , in the present investigation , the spray - deposited ASI7 was extruded at various temperatures and extrusion ratios to study the effect of extrusion conditions on the mechanical properties , thereby establishing optimum extrusion conditions for further investigation . 
Figures 8 ( a ) and ( b ) show the variations in the room - temperature tensile properties with extrusion temperature for 4 : 1 and 16 : 1 area reduction ratios , respectively . 
The materials extruded with an extrusion ratio of 4 : 1 exhibited a relative low strength at intermediate extrusion temperatures . 
As shown in Figure 8 , the strength corresponding to materials extruded at 633 and 773 K are higher than those extruded at 673 and 723 K . 
The materials extruded using a 16 : 1 area reduction ratio exhibited a trend similar to that of those extruded using a 4 : 1 ratio , with the exception that the minimum strength of the former material occurred at 723 K . 
It is important to note that the integrity of the material extruded at 773 K using a 16 : 1 extrusion ratio was affected by hot shortness . 
Therefore , on the basis of the present results , it is evident that an extrusion temperature of 673 K and a 16 : 1 reduction ratio represent the optimal extrusion conditions . 
To study the influence of grain size of the A1 matrix and the size of Si dispersoids on the mechanical behavior of spray - deposited ASI7 , materials extruded at 673 K with an area reduction ratio of 16 : 1 were subsequently subjected to isothermal heat treatment at 773 K . 
The resuits of these studies , summarized in Figures 9 ( a ) and ( b ) , reveal a trend of decreasing strength with thermal exposure for a time period of up to 36 hours , immediately followed by an increase in strength with thermal exposure . 
The trend observed at 423 K was very similar to that observed at room temperature . 
The roomtemperature mechanical properties of the as - spraydeposited and heat - treated AS17 are also summarized in Table IV in comparison with those of the hypereutectic alloys of similar compositions but processed utilizing alternative processing techniques . 
It is evident from the results shown in Table IV that in the as - spray - deposited and the as - extruded conditions , the yield strength of spraydeposited ASI7 is lower than that of the RS RM AI - Si alloy but is generally higher than that of sand and permanent mold - cast A390 alloy . 
The elongation of the spraydeposited AS17 is , however , considerably higher than that of the cast A390 . 
The elongation of the spraydeposited alloy is in the range of 3 . 0 to 7 . 2 pct , whereas that of the IM A390 is generally less than 1 pct . 
For the purpose of comparison , the IM A390 was also extruded and heat treated . 
Following a T6 treatment , the strength of both A390 and spray - deposited AS17 was improved . 
However , in the T6 condition , the strength of spraydeposited AS17 was much higher than that of A390 , which had an identical chemical composition . 
Macroscop ~ cally , the fracture surface of spray - deposited and hot - extruded samples tested at room temperature was relatively flat , suggestive of brittle fracture . 
This is consistent with the results shown in Table IV , which show that the total elongation to fracture was generally less than 7 . 2 pct . 
With the exception of an increase in elongation , the spray - deposited and extruded material tested at 423 K exhibited a fracture morphology similar to that of equivalent material tested at room temperature . 
In contrast to the macroscopic appearance , the SEM fractographs shown in Figure 10 , which were taken from material fractured at room temperature , reveal a dimple type of fracture morphology . 
Close inspection of the fracture surface shows that microscopically the fracture surface exhibited both ductile and brittle fracture features . 
Whereas the matrix material in the edge regime of the dimples revealed extensive plasticity indicative of ductile fracture , that in the center of the dimples was relatively featureless , suggesting brittle fracture . 
This is supported by the fractographic surface features shown in Figure 10 ( b ) , which reveal the presence of secondary cracks in the center of the dimples . 
The macroscopically brittle , microscopically ductile fracture morphology observed in AS I7 closely resembles that of MMCs reinforced with ceramic particulates . 
It is worth noting that the size of the dimples is generally larger than the average size of the Si particulates . 
Moreover , the size of the dimples followed a linear relationship with that of the Si particulates ( Figure 11 ) . 
Energy - dispersive spectroscopy ( EDS ) analysis was performed on the fracture surfaces . 
The results indicate that the center of the dimples was rich in Si , whereas the edges were rich in AI . 
Figure 12 shows the EDS elemental maps taken from the fracture surface . 
It can be seen that the distribution of Si is nonuniform , being rich in the dimple center , while Cu is relatively uniformly distributed , suggestive of fracture of Si particulates during deformation . 
To investigate the behavior of the Si particulates during deformation and fracture , the heat - treated tensile test samples were polished and subsequently stretched at room temperature to various amounts of plastic strain . 
The stretched samples were examined using an optical microscope . 
The microstructure of such deformed samples is shown in Figure 13 . 
There are two important microstructural observations that may be deduced from Figure 13 . 
First , both debonding and fracture of the Si particulates occurred during plastic deformation . 
Second , coarse Si particulates appeared to fracture more frequently than fine Si particulates . 
The latter suggestion is supported by the statistical analysis of the size distribution of the fractured and the debonded Si particulates . 
As shown by the size distribution in Figure 14 , the average size of fractured and debonded Si particulates is much greater than that of the unfractured ( un - debonded ) ones . 
The fraction of fractured and debonded particulates was plotted as a function of the average particulate size , as shown in Figure 15 . 
The results presented herein show that the average size of fractured and debonded Si particulates increases with increasing average particulate size , suggestive of a stronger tendency toward particulate fracture and debonding with increasing particulate size ( Figure 15 ) . 
The two salient microstructural features present in asspray - deposited AS17 alloy are the particulate - like Si pfiase and the equiaxed grains . 
The regular eutectic AI - Si phase and primary Si blocks commonly associated with IM hypereutectic AI - Si alloys were suppressed . 
The presence of a fine dispersion of particulate - like Si phase has also been observed by other investigators working with RS PM hypereutectic AI - Si alloys . Although a detailed analysis of this phenomenon was not attempted , the presence of particulate - like Si dispersoids was attributed to the high cooling rate , on the order of 10 ^ 4 to 10 ^ 6 K s - ^ 1 , typically associated with RS PM processes . 
The origin bf the particulate - like Si dispersoids observed in spray - deposited AS17 is presently not well understood . 
The formation of particulate - like Si phase , however , may be attributed to three possible causes . 
First , the relatively high cooling rates present during deposition ( 2 . 0 to 4 . 6 x 10 ^ 3 K s - ^ 1 ) may effectively alter the morphological stability of the Si phase . 
Second , the repeated deformation and fracture experienced by the partially solidified droplets during deposition may effectively break the Si phase that formed prior to the deposition stage . 
The presence of such Si phase increases the nucleation kinetics of Si by increasing the number density of nuclei in the top layer of the spray - deposited material , thereby suppressing the formation of eutectic A1 - Si during deposition . 
Third , it is likely that the formation of the particulate - like Si phase is a result of the competition between nucleation and growth in front of the solid / liquid ( S / L ) interface in the top layer of the spray - deposited material . 
As discussed by Fabietti and Sekhar , when a concentration gradient is present in front of the S / L interface , the dendritic or planar growth front may be replaced by an equiaxed structure . 
In the case of AI - Si hypereutectic alloy , the Si growth front rejects A1 atoms into the liquid alloy . 
As a result , there is a local region of low Si concentration present in front of the S / L interface . 
This leads to a relatively low liquidus at the interfacial area . 
The liquidus temperature , however , increases with increasing distance from the interface as the concentration in the liquid phase approaches the bulk concentration of the alloy . 
When a positive thermal gradient is present , as in the case of spray deposition , a maximum undercooling will occur at some distance from the S / L interface . 
This suggestion is shown schematically in Figure 16 ( a ) . 
When the constitutional undercooling is large enough , new grains of Si may form in front of the S / L interface , resulting in the formation of particulate - like Si particles . 
The presence of an equiaxed grain morphology in the as - spray - deposited material agrees with the results of previous studies on spray - deposited unreinforced and reinforced materials of various compositions . There are two basic mechanisms proposed in the literature that can be used to explain this equiaxed grain morphology : equiaxed grain formation by dendrite arm fragmentation and equiaxed grain development by growth and coalescence of dendrite flagments during solid - state cooling . In the first mechanism 
( i . e . , dendrite ann fragmentation ) , dendrite arm fragments are considered to be the major cause for the formation of equiaxed grains . 
In correlating the observed equiaxed microstructure with the dynamic processes in spray deposition , Lavernia and co - workers and Annavarapu et al . suggest that , as a result of the incidence of solid , liquid , and semiliquid droplets , a semiliquid / semisolid layer develops on the deposition surface . 
The impact of solid and semisolid droplets on the deposition surface provides dendrite arm fragments , which may act as nucleation centers for equiaxed grains . 
Regarding the formation of equiaxed grains during solidstate cooling , Liang et al . propose that the equiaxed grains evolve from two distinct processes during solidstate cooling in Ni - base alloys : ( 1 ) the homogenization of dendrite arms that did not deform extensively during deposition and ( 2 ) the growth and coalescence of deformed and fractured dendrite arms . 
Support to this suggestion was provided by experimental and numerical results obtained on spray - deposited Ni3A1 , suggesting that the microstructure in the bulk spray - deposited Ni3A1 is exposed to a high - temperature thermal exposure in the deposition stage . 
In view of the low melting temperature of the present material , dendritic arm fragmentation is likely to be the mechanism that caused the formation of equiaxed grains . 
Moreover , in view of the hypereutectic composition of the present material , the Si particulates that form first from the melt may also enhance nucleation of A1 through an epitaxy growth mechanism . 
Inspection of the results summarized in Table IV reveals that the strength of as - spray - deposited AS17 is comparable to that of the die - cast A390 and is much higher than that of the sand and permanent mold - cast A390 , in spite of the fact that there is 1 . 5 to 2 . 4 vol pct porosity present in the former material . 
This observation is not totally surprising in view of the fact that during spray deposition , the material experienced nonequilibrium solidification conditions . 
The relatively high cooling rates and concomitant high interfacial velocities present during spray deposition are generally thought to be responsible for the presence of metastable solid solutions and other nonequilibrium microstructural characteristics often observed in spray - deposited materials . 
Gupta et al . , for example , reported the presence of a metastable solid solution in spray - deposited Al - 4 . 0 wt pct Ti , containing up to 0 . 88 wt pct Ti . 
In contrast , under equilibrium conditions , Ti exhibits negligible solubility in solid Al . 
The observed decrease in strength of AS17 , with increasing extrusion temperature , agrees with the results of Zhou and Duszczyk , who observed a general decrease in the strength of RSPM hypereutectic AI - Si alloys with increasing extrusion temperature , up to 748 K . 
This decrease in strength may be attributed to the increasing dynamic recovery with increasing extrusion temperature . 
The relatively high strength of the materials extruded at 773 K was unexpected and may be attributed to a solid - solution - strengthening effect . 
In fact , the AS17 alloy composition is known to have solution strengthening upon cooling from processing temperatures . Since the high cooling rate was experienced by the present material following extrusion , i . e . , 230 K / min , a solutionstrengthening effect is expected . 
Supersaturation of the A1 lattice in the present alloy was detected by X - ray lattice parameter measurements . 
As shown in Table II , the lattice parameter of the material extruded at 773 K is 0 . 032 pct less than that of the pure A1 . 
If the atomic size of Cu is considered , this lattice parameter decrease means a supersaturation of 1 . 0 wt pct . 
Supersaturation was confirmed by EDS analysis in the TEM thin films . 
The present EDS results indicate that the average concentration of Cu and Mg in the A1 matrix was 1 . 5 and 0 . 8 wt pct , respectively ' . 
Moreover , the Si concentration in the matrix was essentially less than the detection limit of EDS . 
Inspection of the results shown in Figure 6 suggests that thermal exposure of this material at 773 K for 110 hours resulted in growth of the Si particulates and grains . 
Surprisingly , the strength of spray - deposited and extruded AS I7 did not show a monotonic decrease with thermal exposure . 
As indicated by Figure 9 , the strength of the material isothermally treated at 773 K exhibited an initial decrease for a time period of less than 36 hours ; further annealing resulted in an increase in strength . 
Regarding the strengthening of ASI7 , there are several possible mechanisms that may be operative . 
These include texture effect , grain size effect , differential coefficient of thermal expansion ( Δ CTE ) , induced immobile dislocations , and load transfer from the matrix to the Si particulates . 
Regarding texture development in particulatereinforced materials , extensive work has been conducted in recent years . 
The results of these studies demonstrated that nondeformable particulates of a size greater than 0 . 1 μ m may alter texture formation significantly . Particulates may cause either deformation zones with " disperse " sharp texture components or stimulate localized nucleation of recrystallized grains at the particulatematrix interfaces . 
Both effects contribute to a texture that is almost random in these materials . 
In a recent study of particulate - reinforced A1 - Li metal - matrix composite ( MMC ) Przystupa et a1 . noted that the texture in the particulate - containing material is much weaker as compared with that of the unreinforced matrix . 
They attributed this effect to the absence of redundant shears in the presence of nondeformable particulates ( greater than 0 . 1 μ m ) . 
The present AS17 contains 19 . 8 vol pct of Si particulates in the size range of 2 . 5 to 6 . 1 μ m . 
Therefore , it is anticipated that the texture , if any , will be relatively random . 
In fact , isothermal heat treatment at high temperatures may increase this randomness . 
Accordingly , texture is unlikely to be responsible for the observed differences in strength with increasing isothermal heating time , as shown in Figure 9 . 
Alternatively , we consider the AI - Si alloy as a MMC , consisting of a soft A1 matrix with interdispersed Si particulates . 
A well - defined microstrnctural characteristic of MMCs that are reinforced with ceramic reinforcements is a high density of immobile dislocations . 
Arsenault and Shi and Vogelsang et al . , for example , conducted a series of direct TEM observations on A1 alloybase MMCs . 
Their results indicate that a dislocation density as high as l0 ^ 13 to 10 ^ 14 m - ^ 2 is present in the vicinity of the particulate / matrix interface . 
The origin of these immobile dislocations was attributed to the large difference in CTE between ceramic reinforcements and metal matrices . 
The Δ CTE - generated high dislocation density has been considered to be a major strengthening mechanism in discontinuously reinforced MMCs . 
In AI alloy - base MMCs , a commonly selected reinforcement is SiC . 
A comparison of the CTEs of AI , SiC , and Si indicates that the CTEs of AI and SiC are 23 . 2x10 - ^ 6 K - ^ 1 and 4 . 6x10 - ^ 6 K - ^ 1 , respectively , whereas that of Si is 2 . 5 x 10 - ^ 6 K - ^ 1 . 
Because the difference in CTE between A1 and Si is greater than that between AI and SiC , a higher dislocation density due to Δ CTE is expected in the former combination . 
Hence , in view of the large Δ CTE between A1 and Si , strengthening by immobile dislocations should be considered . 
Accordingly , the Si particulate / matrix interfaces were examined to reveal the presence of immobile dislocations . 
As an example , Figure 17 shows the TEM micrographs taken from the ASI7 alloy following 100 hours of isothermal heat treatment . 
The interface between Si and the matrix is well defined . 
Moreover , a high density of dislocations was present in the vicinity of the interface ( Figure 7 ( b ) ) . 
The dislocation density determined from the TEM observation is 1 . 1 x l0 ^ 14 m - ^ 2 , in agreement with the results of Arsenault et a1 . obtained on 1100 AI reinforced with 20 vol pct of SiC particulates ( 4 . 7 x 10 ^ 13 to 1 . 8 x 10 ^ 14 m - ^ 2 ) . 
The microstructure of as - spray - deposited AS17 is composed primarily of particulate - shaped Si phase and equiaxed grains , with the absence of regular eutectic AI - Si and primary Si blocks . 
The presence of these microstructural features was discussed in light of the relatively high cooling rate and nucleation kinetics present during atomization and deposition . In the as - spray - deposited condition , the strength of AS17 is comparable to that of the die - cast A390 alloy but is higher than that of sand and permanent moldcast A390 in spite of the presence of 1 . 5 to 2 . 4 vol pct porosity . 
Following a T6 treatment , the AS 17 exhibited a much higher strength than that of A390 . 
In the T6 condition , the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of the AS17 are 506 and 532 MPa , respectively . 
In contrast , the corresponding yield strength and ultimate strength of A390 are 374 and 387 MPa , respectively . 
In addition , the ductility of spraydeposited AS17 is generally improved over that of the A390 counterpart for the thermomechanical conditions studied herein . Elevated - temperature annealing at 773 K resulted in coarsening , of both grains and Si particulates . 
The strength of the heat - treated materials , however , exhibits an unusual behavior during microstructural coarsening . 
While the initial microstructural coarsening leads to a decrease in strength , prolonged thermal exposure leads to an increase in strength . 
This behavior was discussed in light of stress concentration at the Si / matrix interfaces and load transfer from the matrix alloy to the hard Si particulates during plastic deformation . 
Title : Effect of rapid solidification on the microstructure and mechanical properties of hot - pressed Al – 20Si – 5Fe alloys 
The aim of this work is to study the effect of cooling rate and subsequent hot consolidation on the microstructural features and mechanical strength of Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 2X ( X = Cu , Ni and Cr ) alloys . 
Powder and ribbons were produced by gas atomization and melt spinning processes at two different cooling rates of 1 × 10 5 K / s and 5 × 10 7 K / s . 
The microstructure of the products was examined using optical microscopy , scanning electron microscopy , transmission electron microscopy , and X - ray diffraction . 
The particles were consolidated by hot pressing at 400 ° C / 250 MPa / 1 h under a high purity argon atmosphere and the microstructure , hardness and compressive strength of the compacts were evaluated . 
Results showed a profound effect of the cooling rate , consolidation stage , and transition metals on the microstructure and mechanical strength of Al – 20Si – 5Fe alloys . 
While microstructural refining was obtained at both cooling rates , the microstructure of the atomized powder exhibited the formation of fine primary silicon ( ~ 1 μ m ) , eutectic Al – Si phase with eutectic spacing of ~ 300 nm , and δ - iron intermetallic . 
Supersaturated Al matrix containing 5 – 7 at . % silicon and nanometric Si precipitates ( 20 – 40 nm ) were determined in the microstructure of the melt - spun ribbons . 
The hot consolidation resulted in coarsening of Si particles in the atomized particles , and precipitation of Si and Fe - containing intermetallics from the supersaturated Al matrix in the ribbons . 
The consolidated ribbons exhibited higher mechanical strength compared to the atomized powders , particularly at elevated temperatures . 
The positive influence of the transition metals on the thermal stability of the Al – 20Si – 5Fe alloy was noticed , particularly in the Ni - containing alloy . 
Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 2X ( X = Cu , Ni , Cr ) alloys ( nominal composition in wt . % ) were prepared by melting commercially pure metals in a graphite crucible in air . 
Powders were produced by nitrogen atomization of the superheated melts at 1120 ± 10 K at the gas pressure of 0 . 8 MPa . 
The particles are irregular in shape and the particle size distribution is broad ( Fig . 1a ) . 
The powders were sieved and the particles with the size range of 25 – 63 μ m were used for the subsequent examinations . 
Fig . 1b and c show a scanning electron micrograph and the size distribution of the powder particles after sieving . 
Ribbons were produced by the chill - block melt spinning process by means of impinging a jet of molten alloy onto the cylindrical surface of a copper wheel with a diameter of 23 cm rotating at 40 m / s . 
The crucible orifice for ejecting the melt was 0 . 7 mm . 
The temperature of the melt before ejection was 1020 ± 10 K . 
The dimensions of the as - produced ribbons were 2 mm in width and 20 – 40 μ m in thickness . 
The rapidly solidified ribbons were pulverized by milling in a Tumbling mixer / miller in a plastic box containing 10 mm hardened chrome steel balls with the ball to choppedribbon weight ratio of 10 : 1 for 30 min . 
The obtained powders were sieved and particles with sizes less than 106 μ m were used for consolidation . 
Fig . 2 shows a representative scanning electron micrograph of the pulverized ribbons after sieving . 
Various techniques were used to characterize the products . The particle size distribution was examined using a laser particle size analyzer ( Expert 95 , Fritsch , Germany ) . 
The morphology of the particles was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy ( Tescan VEGA Ι Ι XMU , Czech Republic ) . Phase characterization was performed by X - ray diffraction ( XRD , Philips Xpert ) using Cu K α radiation ( λ = 1 . 5406 Å ) at 2 θ - step of 0 . 02 ° and scanning duration of 1 s from 15 ° to 80 ° . 
The hardness of the powder particles was measured with a Vickers diamond indenter in a micro - hardness tester ( Micromet 2100 , Buehler , USA ) at applied load of 10 g . 
The microstructural examinations were conducted by an optical microscope ( Olym - pus BX51M , Japan ) and scanning electron microscopy coupled with an energy - dispersive X - ray analyzer . 
In order to reveal the details of the microstructure , the alloys were electrochemically etched in a solution comprising 33 % HNO 3 and 67 % H 2 O for 3 s . The voltage and current were 10 – 15 DC V and 5 – 10A , respectively . 
The size and morphology of the primary silicon and intermetallic phases were characterized by using Clemex Vision image analyzer ( PE 4 , Clemex Technologies Inc . , Canada ) . 
The reported values are the average of 100 measurements . 
Transmission electron microscopy ( CM200 , Philips ) coupled with electron - dispersive X - ray spectroscopy was also employed to study the microstructure of the ribbons . 
Hot pressing was performed to consolidate the powders into small cylindrical specimens with 10 mm diameter and 5 mm height . 
The process was performed in a steel die coated with boron nitride under a high purity argon atmosphere . 
The heating rate , compaction pressure , temperature and dwell time were 10 K / min , 250 MPa , 673 K , and 60 min , respectively . 
After consolidation , the density of the compacts was measured using the water displacement method according to ASTM B311 - 93 . 
The density was found to be ~ 99 % . 
The phase characterization and microstructural features of the consolidated samples were examined by X - ray diffraction , optical microscopy and electron microscopy as explained above . 
Compression test was used to determine the strength of the compacts . 
A servo control universal testing machine ( Gotech , AI - 7000 L , China ) at the strain rate of 1 . 66 × 10 − 3 s − 1 was utilized . 
The testing temperatures were 298 , 473 and 573 K . 
The Vickers hardness of the compacts was determined using a hardness tester ( Instron Wolpert , Germany ) at the indentation load of 30 kg . 
Fig . 3 shows the microstructure of gas - atomized and melt - spun Al – 20Si – 5Fe alloy . 
The microstructure of the atomized particle consisted of particle - like Si , fine eutectic Al – Si phase and an acicular intermetallic compound ( Fig . 3a and b ) . 
The average size of the primary Si particles and the eutectic spacing is 1 ± 0 . 3 μ m and 300 ± 40 nm , respectively . 
Scanning electron study coupled with energy - dispersive X - ray analysis indicated that the inter - metallic phase is an iron - containing compound with a length of 3 . 6 ± 0 . 5 μ m and an aspect ratio of 4 ± 0 . 3 . 
The micro - hardness measurement of the particles indicated a value of 196 ± 6 HV 0 . 01 which is significantly higher than that of the cast alloy with the approximate composition of Al – 20Si – 3 . 3Fe ( 84 ± 5 . 4 HV 0 . 025 [ 9 ] ) . 
Fig . 3c shows an optical micrograph taken from the as - solidified ribbon . 
A featureless zone with an average thickness of 6 μ m is seen in the wheel - side . 
In the free - side , the microstructure is dendritic , which has an average arm spacing of about 150 ± 20 nm ( Fig . 3d ) . 
Fig . 4 shows a bright - field transmission electron image and selected area diffraction pattern of the ribbon . 
Fine distribution of spherical Si particles with an average size of 30 ± 10 nm is seen . 
No evidence of the intermetallic phase formation could be noticed . 
The micro - hardness analysis indicates value of 350 ± 8HV 0 . 01 for the cross section of ribbon . 
Fig . 5 shows the X - ray diffraction patterns of the rapidly solidified Al – 20Si – 5Fe alloy . 
The pattern of the gas - atomized powder exhibits the diffraction peaks of α - Al , diamond - cubic Si , and tetragonal δ - Al 4 FeSi 2 ( Fig . 5 ( a ) ) in agreement with its microstructure ( Fig . 3a and b ) . 
The X - ray diffraction peaks of the wheel - and free - side of the ribbon are shown in Fig . 5 ( b ) and ( c ) . 
Only diffraction peaks of the aluminum and low - intensity peaks of Si are visible . 
This indicates over - equili - brium dissolution of Si in the aluminum lattice due to high undercooling . 
Besides the X - ray diffraction limitation indetecting low volume concentrations ( typically 5 vol . % [ 9 ] ) , the absence of the intermetallic phase at X - ray diffraction pattern also reveals the extended solid solubility of the matrix . 
Similar to the Al – 20Si – 5Fe alloy , the microstructure and phase formation of the rapidly solidified powders containing Cu , Ni and Cr were studied . 
The only noticeable difference was related to the effect of Cr on the morphology and size of the primary Si and the iron - containing intermetallic . 
Fig . 6a shows the microstructural features of the Al alloy with 2 wt . % Cr addition after electrochemical etching to reveal the details . 
EDS analyses on a Si particle and an intermetallic particle are observed in Fig . 6b and c , respectively . 
The X - ray diffraction pattern is shown in Fig . 6d . 
It is noticeable that the morphology of the acicular intermetallic is changed to spherical shape in the presence of Cr while the composition remained unchanged ( tetragonal δ - Al 4 FeSi 2 ) . 
It is also visible that the average size of the Si particles and the intermetallic phase is almost half of the alloy without chromium ( see Fig . 3a and b ) . 
In addition , a higher hardness ( 221 ± 5 HV 0 . 01 ) was obtained when 2 wt . % Cr was added to the ternary alloy . 
When melt spinning was carried out , the effect of transition metals on the microstructure and phase formation was marginal ; no significant differences could be noticed . 
For instance , Fig . 7 shows a bright - field transmission electron micrograph and X - ray diffraction pattern of the Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 2Cr ribbon . 
Nanometric Si particles are distributed in the aluminum matrix ( Fig . 7a ) . 
The Si precipitates are finer compared to the base alloy shown in Fig . 4a . 
No new phases are noticed in the diffraction pattern ( Fig . 7b ) . 
The gas - atomized powders and pulverized melt - spun ribbons were hot pressed into bulk cylindrical shapes and the microstructure and mechanical strength of the compacts were examined . 
Fig . 8 shows the microstructural features of Al – 20Si – 5Fe alloy . 
The primary silicon and acicular intermetallic compound are visible which have almost the same size as in the powder state ( Fig . 8a ) . 
In contrast with the atomized powder , the microstructure of the melt - spun ribbon undergoes remarkable change . 
As seen in Fig . 8b for compacts manufactured from the melt - spun ribbons , fine silicon particles are formed . 
Fig . 9 shows the X - ray diffraction patterns of the consolidated powders . 
The diffraction peaks of α - Al and Si phases are identifiable in the both materials . 
The higher intensity of ( 111 ) Si peak and the shift in the Al lines to lower 2 θ angles , particularly in the case of ribbon , indicate Si precipitation during the hot consolidation process . 
The X - ray diffraction pattern of the compacts also shows the presence of β - Al 5 FeSi phase . 
It seems that the δ - intermetallic was transformed to stable β - phase during processing of the gas - atomized powder . 
Microstructural study of the alloys containing the transition metals indicated similar results . 
Except Cr which refined the microstructure , no significant effect of Cu and Ni on the microstructural features could be outlined . 
Fig . 10a shows the microstructure of gas - atomized Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 2Cr alloy after hot consolidation and electrochemical etching . 
The microstructure is rather similar to that of the ternary alloy but the acicular intermetallic phase is in fine spherical shape . 
Transmission electron study revealed that Si coarsening occurred during hot consolidation of the pulverized ribbon ( Fig . 10b ) . 
In addition , nanometric precipitation of ironcontaining intermetallic occurred ( see electron - dispersive X - ray spectrum shown in Fig . 10c ) . 
X - ray diffraction analysis indicated the composition of the intermetallic phase as Al95Fe4Cr ( Fig . 10d ) . 
The hardness and compressive strength of the hot - pressed powders and ribbons are reported in Table 1 . 
For comparison , the hardness of conventionally cast alloys with the same compositions is listed [ 16 ] . 
One can notice the higher hardness of the compacts produced by the rapid solidification processes compared with the conventionally cast alloys . 
Higher hardness was obtained when melt spinning was performed . 
The positive influence of the transition metals on the hardness was also noticeable . 
Similar results were obtained from the compression test , i . e . rapid solidification and alloying with the transition metals improved the strength , particularly at the elevated temperatures . 
Nickel was found to be the most effective element in increasing the strength . 
The effect of cooling rate and transition alloying elements on the microstructure and mechanical strength of as - solidified and hot - pressed Al – 20Si – 5Fe alloy was studied . 
The findings can be summarized as follow . 
The microstructure of gas - atomized powder ( cooling rate of 1 × 10 5 K / s ) consisted of particle - like Si , fine eutectic Si and iron - containing intermetallic compound ( δ - phase ) . 
Increasing the cooling rate to 5 × 10 7 K / s by melt spinning resulted in supersaturation of the aluminum matrix and the formation of nanometric Si precipitates . 
No appreciable effect of Cu and Ni on the microstructural features of the gas - atomized powder was noticed . 
Cr altered the morphology of the iron - containing intermetallic compound and refined the primary silicon particles . 
The hardness of the rapidly solidified powders was almost double of the conventionally cast ( low cooling rate ) alloys . 
The microstructure of the melt - spun ribbons exhibited a featureless zone caused by diffusionless solidification and a dendritic zone in the free - side due to the lower undercooling . 
After hot consolidation of the gas - atomized powders , the microstructural changes included transformation of metastable δ - phase to stable β - phase and coarsening of silicon particles . 
The microstructure of the hot - pressed pulverized ribbons included ultrafine Si particles ( 150 – 200 nm ) and nanometric iron - containing intermetallic compound . 
The addition of transition metals significantly improved the hardness and compressive strength of Al – 20Si – 5Fe alloy . 
Here , nickel was found to be more effective . 
An improved mechanical strength was obtained when the higher cooling rate was employed . 
Title : Load Relaxation and Creep Behavior of a Spray Cast Hypereutectic Al - 25Si - 2Cu - 1Mg Alloy 
We studied the high temperature deformation behavior of a spray cast Al - 25Si - 2Cu - 1Mg alloy within the framework of an internal variable theory for inelastic deformation . 
We then carried out a series of load relaxation tests at elevated temperatures to obtain flow curves between flow stress and strain rate . 
The results were analyzed based on constitutive relations prescribed by an internal variable theory . 
The hypereutectic Al - 25Si2Cu - 1Mg alloy exhibited two distinctly different deformation modes , viz . plastic deformation induced by dislocation glides and creep deformation by dislocation climbs at high temperatures . 
These load relaxation test results were then compared with those obtained from a series of creep tests performed at elevated temperatures under various stress levels . 
They were found to agree well with each other , providing a means to replace the time - consuming creep test by a simple load relaxation test in order to obtain high temperature creep data . 
An internal variable theory has been proposed based on dislocation dynamics to provide a more comprehensive understanding of inelastic deformation behavior . 
Dislocations are now well known to glide on slip planes in response to applied stress until they are blocked by strong barriers such as grain boundaries in order to produce internal strain energy . 
This strain energy due to accumulated dislocations could then be reduced through various slip transfer mechanisms [ 9 , 10 ] . 
Non - recoverable plastic strain rate ( α · ) was then viewed in the theory due to the relaxation of internal strain energy through the passage of glide dislocations to grain boundaries . 
In this way , the theory essentially views inelastic deformation as a simultaneous process of accumulation and relaxation of glide dislocations within slip zones and across strong barriers , respectively in order to produce an internal strain ( a ) and plastic strain rate ( α ) as prescribed in detail in the reference [ 9 ] . 
At elevated temperatures , additional relaxation processes can be operated to reduce accumulated internal strain energy , for example through a dislocation climb around strong barriers such as grain boundaries to generate a creep strain rate ( β · ) [ 10 , 12 ] . 
The time rate of change ≈ denotes a co - rotational material time derivative of internal strain tensor ( a ) , similar to that prescribed earlier by Hart [ 11 ] . 
This internal strain rate a ° due to accumulated glide dislocations within active slip zones could generally be neglected if the load relaxation tests were performed uniaxially under a steady state . 
The stresses required for dislocation glides have been well recognized to consist of the friction stress ( σ ) required to overcome the short - range interaction force between glide dislocation and lattice and the internal stress ( σ ) required to overcome the long - range interaction force among gliding dislocations to gives [ 9 ] , A physical as well as a rheological model could then be constructed by identifying the conjugate relationship among the various internal state variables . 
The results are schematically presented in Fig . 1 . 
Constitutive relations of plastic strain rate ( α ) and creep strain rate ( β ) were then regarded as mechanical activation processes caused by internal stress to give , with P α and P β denoting the dislocation permeability parameters , σ α ∗ and α ∗ an internal strength and its conjugate reference strain rate for plastic deformation , and σ β * and β · ∗ an internal strength and its conjugate reference strain rate for creep deformation [ 12 , 13 ] . 
The temperature dependence of α ∗ and β · ∗ were next prescribed in a classical Arrhenius type relation as , with f denoting jump frequency , µ shear modulus , n scaling parameter , and Q activation energy for each corresponding deformation mechanism . 
The activation energies for dislocation glide and dislocation climb can then be prescribed precisely by differentiating Eqns . 
5 and 6 after taking the natural logarithm of both sides as , with R now representing the gas constant . 
The constitutive relation between σ and ε · was next regarded as a viscous flow process due to frictional drag of lattice in the theory , but this stress is relatively small compared to internal stress at elevated temperatures . 
The friction stress is therefore irrelevant to the present study . 
The complete details of theoretical development and the definition of constitutive parameters can be found in referred articles [ 14 - 16 ] . 
The hypereutectic Al - 25 . 0Si - 2 . 0Cu - 1 . 0Mg ( wt . % ) alloy used in this study was produced by an ‘ OSPREY ’ spray casting process , which generally produces various sizes , morphologies and distributions of the primary Si particles in the Al matrix [ 16 ] . 
The typical microstructure of an as - cast alloy is shown in Fig . 2 , exhibiting Si particles with an average size of ~ 5 µ m distributed uniformly in a soft Al - matrix . The alloying elements Cu and Mg were added to improve mechanical properties , especially strengthening the alloy through precipitation hardening . 
Rectangular specimens used in this study were prepared from cylindrical billets and dimensions of 15 mm gauge length with a 5 × 3 mm crosssection area . 
A series of load relaxation tests was then performed using a hard - type mechanical testing machine [ an Instron model No . 8862 ] attached with a 3 - zone electric furnace capable of controlling test temperature within ± 0 . 5 ° C at elevated temperatures ranging from 200 to 500 . 
In the load relaxation tests , a specimen was first loaded in tension to a certain predetermined tensile strain before stopping the crosshead motion . 
Relaxation of the load was then monitored on a realtime basis to store the values of the load in a stand - alone PC . The flow curves in terms of stress and strain rate ( ε · ) were then constructed from the load data , viz . 
P - t curve utilizing the relations prescribed earlier by Lee and Hart [ 18 ] . 
This load relaxation test can , in general , provide a much wider range of strain rates with a minimal plastic straining , so that the flow curves can be regarded as constant structure curves corresponding to the relations given in Eqs . 
3 and 4 . 
Creep tests have also been conducted at temperatures ranging from 300 to 500 to compare with the results obtained from load relaxation tests . 
Creep tests were performed using a creep test machine designed to maintain the condition of constant stress through an air pressure . 
The strain developed during creep tests under a fixed stress was continuously recorded again on a real - time basis using a linear variable differential transformer and consequently used to determine the minimum creep strain rate . 
Flow stress vs . strain rate curves obtained from load relaxation tests at various elevated temperatures are plotted in Fig . 3 in a double log scale to reveal the general trend of shifting the curves to lower stress and higher strain rate region with an increase in test temperature from 200 to 500 . 
In addition , a distinct transition behavior can also be observed at low strain rates for the flow curves above 300 accompanied by a rapid drop in flow stress , a clear indication of a different deformation mechanism activated under lower stresses . These flow curves were then analyzed based on an internal variable theory as prescribed earlier and a typical result for 400 is given in Fig . 4 . 
Solid and broken lines in the figure represent the predicted curves for α and β · prescribed by Eqs . 
3 and 4 , respectively , to exhibit excellent agreement with the experimental data . 
The flow stress - strain rate curves could be resolved in this way into the two independent flow curves of ( α − σ ) and ( β − σ ) representing plasticity due to dislocation glide and creep due to dislocation climb , respectively . 
Transition in flow curves observed at temperatures above 300 is therefore thought to be due to activation of the dislocation climb process under lower stresses . 
The values of the constitutive parameters determined from these flow curve analyses based on an internal variable theory are listed in Table 1 . 
It should be noted here that the dislocation permeability parameters P α and P β were found to have a constant value of 0 . 15 regardless of test temperatures , as expected from previous reports [ 9 , 14 , 15 ] . 
The internal strength parameters σ * α and σ * β were identified to represent the strength of strong barriers such as grain boundaries in crystalline materials can be seen to decrease , while their conjugate reference strain rates α * and β · * increased with increasing test temperature . 
The logarithm values of α * and β · * given in Table 1 are plotted in terms of ( 1 / T ) in Fig . 5 to determine the activation energies as prescribed in Eqs . 
7 and 8 . The activation energies were determined from the slopes as 93 KJ / mol and 145 KJ / mol for the dislocation glide and the dislocation climb , respectively . 
Creep tests were also performed at elevated temperatures to compare with the results of load relaxation tests . The applied stresses for constant stress creep tests were found to correspond with the region for dislocation glide and dislocation climb observed in a load relaxation test for direct comparison purposes . 
The minimum creep strain rates are plotted as a function of applied stresses in Fig . 6 exhibiting the general trend of faster creep rate at higher temperature . 
In addition , the slope of minimum creep rate vs . applied stress can be seen clearly from the figure to change from a higher stress region to lower stress region , providing two separate values of power index n in the power law relation between stress and creep rate . 
This result appears to suggest the existence of two different deformation mechanisms , viz . 
a low stress regime controlled by dislocation climb having the stress exponent value close to n = 5 and the high stress regime controlled by dislocation glide with the stress exponent value close to n = 3 as shown in Fig . 6 . 
The activation energies for dislocation glide and dislocation climb can also be obtained by plotting again the logarithm of normalized minimum creep rates in terms of ( 1 / T ) as shown in Fig . 7 to give 85 KJ / mol and 137 KJ / mol in the high and low stress regions , respectively . 
These activation energies are very similar to the one of 90 KJ / mol for grain boundary diffusion in Al and the one of 140 KJ / mol for lattice self diffusion as reported earlier [ 19 - 21 ] . The change in the power index value n from n = 3 to n = 5 together with the change in activation energy could be interpreted in relation to the transition of the deformation mechanism from a viscous glide controlled by grain boundary diffusion in Al at a higher stress region to a climb controlled by lattice self - diffusion at a lower stress region [ 22 - 25 ] . 
The values of stresses and strain rates were then determined at the transition points from the flow curves from load relaxation tests and also from the minimum creep rate curves at each temperature , the results of which are listed in Table 2 . These transition stresses and strain rates are then plotted in Figs . 8 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively , to characterize early the change of deformation mechanism depending on stress level or strain rate . 
The transition stresses for both the load relaxation and creep tests were found to decrease rapidly as the test temperature was raised , while the transition strain rates to decrease slightly with test temperatures again for both cases . 
An additional deformation behavior due to dislocation climb seems to activate under lower stresses above 300 in this spray cast a hypereutectic Al - 25Si - 2Cu - 1Mg alloy , in addition to the usual plastic deformation observed under a relatively higher stress region . 
This observation then suggests that load relaxation tests can effectively provide data consistent with the ones obtained from time - consuming creep tests , especially for this alloy . 
This study investigated high temperature deformation behavior of a spray cast hypereutectic Al - 25Si - 2Cu - 1Mg alloy by applying an internal variable theory at elevated temperatures . 
Creep tests were also performed and the results were compared with those obtained from load relaxation tests . 
Some of the important results are obtained as follows ; 
( 1 ) The flow stress - strain rate curves obtained from load relaxation tests were found to consist of two separate flow curves of ( α − σ I ) and ( β − σ I ) due to dislocation glide and dislocation climb , respectively , based on internal variable theory . 
( 2 ) The minimum creep rates were found to increase slightly with rising test temperatures , while the creep stresses were found to reduce rapidly with temperature increases . 
This was consistent with the relaxation test results . 
( 3 ) The activation energies of hypereutectic Al - 25Si - 2Cu1 Mg alloy were obtained as 93 KJ / mol and 145 KJ / mol for dislocation glides and climbs , respectively , from load relaxation tests . 
Creep tests provided also the activation energies as 85 KJ / mol and 137 KJ / mol in higher and lower stress regions , respectively , closely matching the relaxation tests . 
( 4 ) Load relaxation test results were found to match well with the creep test results to suggest an effective means of replacing time consuming creep tests by a much simpler load relaxation test for the present spray cast hypereutectic Al25Si - 2Cu - 1Mg alloy . 
Title : Spray Casting of Al - 25Si Alloy and Hot Deformation Behavior 
The spray forming process was used to produce Al - 25Si alloy in this study . 
The microstructure of the hypereutectic Al - 25Si alloy appeared to consist of Al matrix and equiaxed Si particles with average diameter of 5 ~ 7 µ m . 
To deduce the extrusion condition , a series of compression tests has been conducted at temperatures ranging from RT to 500 ° C . 
The strain rate sensitivity parameter ( m ) of this alloy has been found to be very low ( ≤ 0 . 1 ) below 300 ° C and reached maximum value of about 0 . 13 at 500 ° C . 
The extrusion has been successfully conducted at the temperatures of 300oC and above with the ratio of area reduction of 28 and 40 . 
The processing map for hot working has also been constructed . 
The composition of the present alloy was Al - 25Si ( wt . % ) . 
A 15 - kg - alloy - preform was prepared through the spray casting process with the melt temperature of 850oC . 
The diameter of the billet was 180 mm . 
After measuring the density distribution of billet specimens for compression test , and extrusion were taken from the center part of the billet , having over 97 % of the ideal density . 
The gauge dimensions of specimens were 4 mm × 4 mm × 6 mm . 
For extrusion , billets of 80 mm in diameter were machined . 
A series of compression was then carried out at the temperatures ranging from RT ( 24 ° C ) to 500 ° C under the various strain rates ranging from 10 - 4 / s to 10 - 2 / s . 
After constructing the diagrams of extrusion pressure vs . ram - speed from the compression test results , extrusion has been conducted under various conditions . 
The billet was sectioned through a plane with the rotation axis . 
Some pores were observed only in the bottom of the billet . 
The density measured by the Archimedes ’ method in the top and the middle parts of the billet was more than 97 % of its ideal density . 
Figure 1 shows the typical microstructure of the as - spray - cast billet together with that of IM processed Al - 25Si alloy . 
Coarse primary Si particles and AlFeSi based intermetallic phases are easily seen in the IM processed alloy , while the Si particles in the spray - cast alloy appear to be very uniform in their size ( ~ 6 µ m ) and distribution . 
The AlFeSi based intermetallic phases can also be observed in Fig . 1 ( b ) in the form of thin film type . 
The flow curves of strain rate vs . stress obtained from a series of compression tests conducted at temperatures from RT to 500 ° C are given in Fig . 2 in a log scale , plotting the flow stresses evaluated at the strain level of 1 % as a function of the initial strain rates . 
The flow stresses are observed to be very sensitive to the test temperatures . 
The slope of the flow curve is well known as the strain rate sensitivity parameter ( m ) , characterizing the strain rate dependency of the flow stress and also the measure of high temperature ductility [ 9 ] . 
The m values of spray - cast Al - 25Si alloy are found very small at lower temperatures less than 0 . 1 below 300 ° C but appear to increase remarkably reaching upto about 0 . 13 at 500 ° C . 
Figure 3 shows the relations between the extrusion pressure and ram - speed for the extrusion ratios of r = 28 and 40 , obtained from equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) using the flow data in Fig . 2 . 
During extrusion , it is necessary to control the working pressure below the endurance pressure of the machine . 
The critical pressure is evaluated as 1072 MPa in the case of this study and marked by the horizontal lines in Fig . 3 . 
A series of experimental extrusions were successfully conducted at the ram - speeds of 1 ~ 10 mm / s , for the extrusion ratios of r = 28 and 40 and at the various temperatures above 300 ° C . 
Microstructure observation after the extrusion revealed Si particles refined into an average size of about 2 µ m . As well known , the contours in processing map represent constant efficiency of power dissipation ( η ) , directly related to the relative rate of entropy production in the system , which is caused by a change in the microstructure . 
The dimensionless parameter η is obtained by comparing the dissipative characteristics of the work piece with that of a liner - dissipater and given by 2m / ( m + 1 ) , where m is the strain rte sensitivity of flow stress . 
Detail method of developing the map was given in the other literature on the basis of dynamic materials model [ 12 ] . 
The power dissipation maps were constructed from the compression test results as given in Fig . 4 , which is comparable to those of high strength wrought Al alloys such as 7075 and 8090 Al in the value of power dissipation efficiency [ 12 ] . 
The 180 - mm - diameter billet of a hypereutectic Al - 25Si alloy with over 97 % of ideal density , was produced using the spray casting process in this study . 
The Si particles were found to be uniform in both the distribution and their size . 
The strain rate sensitivity parameter ( m ) of this alloy has been observed to be very low ( ≤ 0 . 1 ) below 300 ° C but to reach the maximum value of about 0 . 13 at 500 ° C from a series of load relaxation and compression tests . 
The diagrams of ram - speed vs . extrusion pressure for this alloy were constructed from the compression test results , providing the extrusion conditions . 
The effectiveness of these diagrams has been confirmed experimentally by conducting extrusions under the various conditions . 
The processing map , which can be used as a guide for hot working , has been constructed . 
Title : Fabrication of spray - formed hypereutectic Al – 25Si alloy and its deformation behavior 
This article reports the fabrication of hypereutectic Al – 25Si alloy , which is expected to be applied to the cylinder liner part of the engine block of an automobile due to its excellent wear resistance , low density and low thermal expansion coefficient , through a spray casting process and the characterization of the microstructural and the mechanical properties of this alloy . 
The OSPREY process used in this study is one of spray forming techniques , which can produce semi - finished products such as billet , tube , and plate with rapid solidification ( RS ) structure and density in a single operation from molten metal . 
The obtained microstructure of the hypereutectic Al – 25Si alloy appeared to consist of Al matrix and equiaxed Si particles with average diameter of 5 – 7 μ m . 
To characterize the deformation behavior of this alloy , a series of load relaxation and compression tests have been conducted at temperatures ranging from RT to 500 ℃ . 
The strain rate sensitivity parameter ( m ) of this alloy has been found to be very low ( ≤ 0 . 1 ) below 300 ℃ and reached maximum value of about 0 . 2 at 500 ℃ . 
During the deformation above 300 ℃ in compression , remarkable strain softening has been observed . 
The extrusion has been successfully conducted at the temperatures of 300 ℃ and above with the ratio of area reduction of 28 and 40 in this study . 
The composition of the present alloy was Al – 25Si . A 15 kg alloy - preform was prepared via the OSPREY spray casting process with the melt temperature of 850 ℃ . 
A schematic drawing of the apparatus used in this study is given in Fig . 1 . The alloy was first melted in a graphite crucible using an induction - heating furnace with a thermocouple placed at the bottom of tundish to monitor the melt temperature . 
The melt stream was then atomized into fine droplets by nitrogen gas at a high pressure , which were deposited onto a substrate positioned at an appropriate distance from the tundish nozzle . 
The diameter of the billet thus obtained was 180 mm . 
After measuring the density distribution of billet , specimens for compression test , load relaxation test , and extrusion were taken from the center part of the billet , having over 97 % of the ideal density . 
The gauge dimensions of specimens were 4 mm × 4 mm × 6 mm for compression tests and 3 mm × 4 mm × 27 mm for load relaxation tests . 
For extrusion , billets of 80 mm in diameter were machined . 
A series of compression and load relaxation tests were then carried out at the temperatures ranging from RT ( 24 ℃ ) to 500 ℃ by using a computer controlled electro - mechanical testing machine ( Instron 1361 model ) , attached with a furnace capable of maintaining the temperature fluctuation within ± 1 ℃ . 
It is well known that load relaxation test can provide a much wider range of strain rates , applying a little amount of plastic strain 1 . 5 % , in this study , to the specimen without an appreciable change in microstructures [ 9 ] . 
Loading strain rate was 5 × 10 ^ - 2s ^ - 1 in all cases . 
In the load relaxation tests employed in this study , the variation of load with time during the tests was monitored through a DVM and stored in a personal computer for the subsequent analysis . 
The flow stresses as a function of inelastic strain rate were determined by following the usual procedure described in the literature [ 10 ] . 
Compression tests were also carried out under the various strain rates ranging from 10 ^ - 4 to 10 ^ - 2s ^ - 1 within the same temperature range . 
After constructing the diagrams of extrusion pressure versus ramspeed from the compression test results , extrusion has been conducted under various conditions . 
Fig . 2 shows the appearance and the density distribution of a spray - cast billet produced in this study . 
The billet was sectioned through a plane with the rotation axis . 
Some pores were observed only in the bottom of the billet . 
The density distribution measured by the Archimedes ’ method are given in Fig . 2 ( b ) exhibiting that the top and the middle parts of the billet have more than 97 % of its ideal density . 
All the specimens for mechanical testing and extrusion have been taken from the part marked by a box in Fig . 2 ( a ) . 
Fig . 3 shows the typical microstructure of the as - spray - cast billet together with the micrograph of IM processed Al – 25Si alloy . As briefly mentioned earlier , coarse primary Si particles ( P ) and AlFeSi based intermetallic phases ( I ) are easily noticed in the IM processed alloy , while the Si particles in the spraycast alloy appear to be very uniform in their size ( ~ 6 μ m ) and distribution . The AlFeSi based intermetallic phases can also be observed in Fig . 3 ( b ) in the form of thin film type . 
The flow curves of strain rate ( ε ) versus stress ( σ ) obtained from a series of load relaxation tests conducted at temperatures from RT to 500 ℃ are given in Fig . 4 in a log scale , showing a wide range of flow data in more than four orders of the strain rates . 
The flow stresses are observed to be very sensitive to the test temperatures . The slope of the flow curve is well known as the strain rate sensitivity parameter ( m ) , characterizing the strain rate dependency of the flow stress and also the measure of high temperature ductility [ 11 ] . 
The m values of spray - cast Al – 25Si alloy are found very small at lower temperatures less than m = 0 . 1 below 300 ℃ but appear to increase remarkably reaching up to about 0 . 2 at 500 ℃ . 
It is very interesting to note that the flow curve obtained at 500 ℃ can be divided into two regions with different m values , suggesting that two different deformation mechanisms might operate for each m value . 
Some compression test results are given in Fig . 5 in terms of the true stress and true strain . 
It should be noted here that the strain - hardening rate is negligible even at the room temperature . 
At higher temperatures , strain softening can be observed , though the degree of which is not remarkable . The flow curves of log strain rate ( ε ) versus log stress ( σ ) can also be obtained from the compression test results , plotting the flow stresses evaluated at the strain level of 1 % as a function of the initial strain rates , as shown in Fig . 6 . 
This result shows somewhat smaller m values than those calculated from load relaxation tests . 
From the earlier theoretical and experimental work , materials with a high degree of flow softening and low m value are known to be prone to a severe shear localization [ 12 ] . 
Although the present alloy shows low m values , it can obviously be hot - worked at the temperatures above 300 ℃ because the degree of flow softening is relatively low and the m value increases steeply as the test temperature increases . 
Fig . 7 shows the relations between the extrusion pressure and ram - speed for the extrusion ratios of r = 28 and 40 , obtained from Eqs . ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) using the flow data in Fig . 6 . 
During extrusion , it is necessary to control the working pressure below the endurance pressure of the machine . 
The critical pressure is evaluated as 1072 MPa in the case of this study and marked by the horizontal lines in Fig . 7 . 
A series of experimental extrusions were successfully conducted at the ram - speeds of 1 – 10 mm s ^ - 1 , for the extrusion ratios of r = 28 and 40 and at the various temperatures above 300 8C . 
Typical microstructures taken before and after the extrusion , with the condition of r ¼ 28 and T = 400 ℃ , are shown in Fig . 8 exhibiting Si particles refined into an average size of about 2 mm after extrusion . 
The 180 mm diameter billet of a hypereutectic Al – 25Si alloy with over 97 % of ideal density , was produced using the OSPREY spray casting process in this study . 
The Si particles were found to be uniform in both the distribution and their size . 
The strain rate sensitivity parameter ( m ) of this alloy has been observed to be very low ( ≤ 0 . 1 ) below 300 8C but to reaches the maximum value of about 0 . 2 at 500 8C from a series of load relaxation and compression tests . 
The diagrams of ram - speed versus extrusion pressure for this alloy were constructed from the compression test results , providing the extrusion conditions . 
The effectiveness of these diagrams has been confirmed experimentally by conducting extrusions under the various conditions . 
After an extrusion , the Si particles were observed to refine into much a smaller size of about 2 μ m . 
Title : Properties and microstructure of Al – 11Si / SiCp composite coatings fabricated by thermal spray 
Thermal spraying has been used to coat 6082 - T6 aluminium alloy with aluminium matrix composites . Mixtures of Al – 11Si powder and 20 vol . % SiC and 40 vol . % SiC particles in the powder feeder were used as spraying material . 
In some conditions , SiC particles were coated with a sol – gel silica coating , which acts as an active barrier enhancing the wettability of the reinforcement by molten aluminium reducing the porosity of the composite coatings and inhibiting the formation of aluminium carbide . 
Coatings with a reinforcement volume fraction up to 17 vol . % ( for 20 vol . % SiC in feeder ) and 27 vol . % ( for 40 vol . % SiC in feeder ) were obtained with porosities below 1 . 0 % . 
In all cases , the incorporation of sol – gel silica coatings on SiC particles reduced the porosity and increased the reinforcement volume fraction and the hardness of the coatings . 
The role played by the different spraying parameters has been also studied . 
The spraying material was fabricated by mixing metallic particles and ceramic ones to spray composite coatings . 
The metallic powder was an Al – 11Si spray powder from Sulzer , i . e . an aluminium alloy that contained approximately 11 . 4 % Si ( measured chemical composition in weight % : Cu = 0 . 01 , Fe = 0 . 14 , Mn b 0 . 01 , Mg = 0 . 01 , Si = 11 . 4 , Zn b 0 . 01 , others : 0 . 03 and Al = bal . ) with a particle mean size of 80 μ m . 
This powder was mixed with SiC in form of particles ( SiCp ) that were fabricated by Navarro S . A . ( Spain ) with a mean size of 52 μ m , which acted as reinforcement in the coatings deposited . 
Feedstock powders with 20 and 40 % in volume of uncoated SiCp and sol – gel coated SiCp were prepared by a conventional rotating ball milling machine using alumina jar and balls . 
Ball milling was carried out in air for 15 min with a ball - to - powder weight ratio of 1 : 1 , ﬁ lling 25 % of jar volume . 
Afterwards , particles were directly used in the thermal spraying equipment . 
The substrates used were 6082 - T6 aluminium alloy with dimensions of 50 × 25 × 5 mm ^ 3 . 
The substrates were sand blasted by corundum prior to thermal spraying to enhance the adhesion of the coating . 
The sol – gel coating was obtained following the next steps : a sol was prepared from TEOS ( tetraethylorthosilicate ) diluted in absolute ethanol 1 : 11 and distilled water 1 : 5 . 
This mixture hydrolysed for 2 h at room temperature under acid conditions to a sol concentration of 204 g L - ^ 1 . 
This procedure was selected after testing of various alternative concentrations , catalysts and precursors . 
Particles were then placed in the sol and stirred for two hours . 
They were then ﬁ ltered and cleaned with distilled water and ethanol , followed by drying for 1 h at 120 ° C to evaporate water and constrained ethanol . Finally , samples were heated at 500 ° C for 1 h more to evaporate organic compounds and to condensate the silica coating [ 13 , 14 ] . 
The spraying was carried out with an oxy - acetylene thermal spray coating system from Castolin ( DS8000 with a SSM40 modulus ) which provided a thermal power of 28 kW by mixing oxygen at 4 bar and 2000 L / h with acetylene at 0 . 7 bar and 1800 L / h . 
The spraying distance , the feeding rate and the number of layers used are shown in Table 1 . 
In all cases a neutral ﬂ ame and a relative speed between gun and substrate of 10 mm / s were used . 
After the spraying procedure , the coated material was let to cool down in air to room temperature . 
The thicknesses of the coatings obtained were in the 0 . 5 to 2 mm range . 
To coat big ﬂ at surfaces , parallel layers have been applied with a lateral displacement of the position of the spraying gun relative to the sample of 1 cm , which implies an overlap of about 20 % of the ﬁ rst coating laid . 
The maximum thickness of the sprayed coating appears in front of the spraying gun and it reduces when moving in the perpendicular direction . 
Because of this , the total thickness of the samples fabricated with two spraying layers was higher but not doubled the thickness of single sprayed ones . 
Samples for microscopy were prepared from the transversal section of the coating and observed in Light Microscope ( LM ) and Scanning Electronic Microscope ( SEM ) ( Philips ESEM XL30 ) with an Energy Dispersive X - ray spectrometer ( EDX ) . 
Porosity and reinforcement percentages were measured with image analysis software on the SEM images . 
Hardness test were carried out using a Vickers Buehler Micromet 2103 micro - hardness tester with loads in the range from 0 . 3 to 2 kg . 
Porosity , reinforcement rate and hardness have been measured in all cases to determine the effect that the different spraying powder mixtures and parameters have in the coating . 
Their effect in the thermal substrate hardness has been also evaluated to determine if their T6 arti ﬁ cial ageing has been modi ﬁ ed .

Spraying of composite coatings with sol – gel coated SiC particles 
The Al – 11Si pre - alloyed powder particles showed the characteristic morphology of gas atomized alloys , i . e . there were ﬁ ne spherical particles forming clusters along with other ﬁ ne particles adhered as satellites at the surface of coarser particles ( Fig . 1a ) . 
The size of the Al – 11Si powder was similar to that of SiCp used . 
The thickness of the solgel silica layer was 0 . 7 μ m [ 17 ] , so it did not have relevant effects in the size or shape of SiCp ( Fig . 1b ) . 
The oxy - acetylene thermal spraying technique has allowed fabricating coatings from different power mixtures : pure Al – 11Si metallic powder , Al – 11Si mixed with 20 vol . % and 40 vol . % of SiCp and Al – 11Si mixed with 20 vol . % and 40 vol . % of sol – gel silica coated SiCp . 
The transversal sections of some of the samples show that the coatings were homogeneous and compact with thicknesses in the 500 and 2000 μ m range and that SiCp were integrated in the aluminium alloy , although the amount of porosity and reinforcement was very dependent on the spraying conditions and on the use of SiCp or sol – gel coated SiCp ( Fig . 2a and b , respectively ) . 
Fig . 2c and d shows a detail of the integration of SiC particles and the matrix . 
It can be seen that the porosity in the interface is lower for the sol – gel coated SiCp than without sol – gel coated SiCp . 
Fig . 3 resumes the porosity and reinforcement rates obtained for the different sprayed coatings ( the number of each column refers to conditions indicated in Table 1 ) to show the effect of the percentage and type of reinforcement particles used . 
The effect of spraying distance , feeding rate and number of layers is analyzed in following sections . 
It can be observed that in most cases the porosity was smaller than 6 % and that it strongly depended on the spraying parameters ; in the unreinforced coating any modi ﬁ cation of the spraying conditions caused porosity to increase up to 15 % ( Fig . 3a ) . 
The addition of particles to the spraying mixture reduced by a large extent the porosity of the coatings ; in the worst case the porosity kept at a reasonable 6 % and values below 1 % were obtained for different spraying conditions . 
In general , considering mean values , the use of sol – gel coatings on the SiCp reduced further the porosity by 25 % as compared with using bare SiCp for the same spraying conditions , and porosity was similar for the 20 vol . % and 40 vol . % sprayed mixtures . 
The real reinforcement rates achieved in the coatings ( Fig . 3b ) was less sensitive to the spraying parameters than porosity . 
The maximum reinforcement rates obtained were 17 vol . % for mixtures containing 20 vol . % SiCp and 27 vol . % for 40 vol . % SiCp mixtures . 
The incorporation of sol – gel silica coatings on the particles increased the reinforcement rates by 10 % , in average . 
The lower transference ef ﬁ ciency of SiCp to the coatings as compared with Al – 11Si powder was partially due to their lower kinetic energy because of its smaller size and higher density ( 3 . 18 g / cm3 vs 2 . 77 g / cm3 ) . 
The other factor that caused the reduction of the coating reinforcement rate was that SiCp cannot directly stick to the substrate . Once some aluminium particles have been deposited at the substrate , the SiCp can adhere to the splats . 
However , if the amount of SiCp at the surface of the sprayed layer is high , the incorporation of more particles will ﬁ nd dif ﬁ culties . 
These phenomena imply that a part of the sprayed particles will always be lost and that there will be a maximum reinforcement rate achievable with this technique . 
There are practical limitations in the deposition of composite coatings from powder mixtures , but the adequate selection of the spraying parameters allowed obtaining reasonably high reinforcement rates while keeping low the porosity of the coating and , although the feeding rate , the number of spraying layer deposited and ﬁ gures evidence that the highest hardness was obtained for the material fabricated with the mixture containing 40 vol . % of sol – gel coated SiCp ( open circles ) and that hardness was higher in the materials containing sol – gel coated SiCp ( open symbols ) that in those sprayed with the as - received SiCp ( closed symbols ) . 
The comparison of Fig . 4a and b evidences that the hardness of the fabricated coatings had a stronger dependency with the reinforcement rate ( Fig . 4a ) than with porosity ( Fig . 4b ) . 
The powder feeding rate is the processing parameter that is the most related with the productivity of a technique and it is much related with the microstructural characteristics of the coating . 
To determine its relevance we have analyzed the morphological characteristics of coatings fabricated with two layers using the same spraying parameters ( in both cases the distance used was 18 cm ) but the amount of material sprayed per time unit , i . e . the feeding rate . 
As it can be observed in Fig . 5 , in the unreinforced coating , the Al – 11Si the splats were more spherical for 1 . 4 g / s feeding rates ( Fig . 5a ) than for the spraying distance are relevant for the quality of the coating , the use of modi ﬁ ed particles by depositing a sol – gel silica layer was the key modi ﬁ cation to optimize the coatings features ( Fig . 3 ) . 
To determine the combined effect of porosity and of reinforcement particles , hardness test were made . 
Its relationship with reinforcement rate and porosity is shown in Fig . 4a and b , respectively . 
These 0 . 8 g / s ( Fig . 5b ) . 
This happened because there was more powder to be heat , so the temperature reached by each particle was lower and it deformed less at its collision with the sample surface . 
In the case of spraying composite coatings , the incorporation of SiCp in the powder mixture visibly reduced the porosity of the coating ( Fig . 5c and d ) at all feeding rates . 
The presence of hard SiCp in the spraying powder may have helped to deform and break the aluminium - silicon splats , limiting the formation of pores between them at the coating . 
Fig . 6 resumes the porosity and reinforcement rates ( Fig . 6a and b , respectively ) measured for the coatings sprayed at two different feeding rates ( 0 . 8 and 1 . 1 g / s ) . 
In all cases , the porosity was higher when spraying the coatings at higher feeding rates , causing an increase of 32 % porosity in the case of Al – 11Si powder and of 27 % when using the highest feeding rate for both tested mixtures of SiCp and Al – 11Si . 
The reinforcement rates achieved increased while increasing the powder feeding rate ( Fig . 6b ) . 
In the case of 0 . 8 g / s feeding rate , only 52 % of the SiCp were adhered during spraying for both mixtures tested , while the amount of particles effectively adhered to the coating in the case of 1 . 1 g / s feeding rate was above 65 % , i . e . the real reinforcement increased by 17 % . 
This behaviour can be explained by means of the evolution of the coating during its spraying ; the higher amount of sprayed material pushes the previously sprayed material and reduces the possibility of badly adhered SiCp to falling down from the coating . 
Hardness testing showed that increasing the feeding rate reduced the hardness of the sprayed coating by 8 % in nearly all cases ( Fig . 7 ) . For the pure Al – 11Si alloy , the hardness reduction was expected as it is caused by the increased porosity of the layer . 
In the case of composite coatings , there were two competing effects , as increasing the feeding rate increased both the porosity of the coating and the reinforcement rate . 
Hardness tests showed that the role played by porosity was much more relevant than that of the slight reinforcement rate enhancement . 
However , the use of mixtures with higher SiCp percentages always led to higher hardness values for the same spraying conditions . 
When coating big surfaces , it is always necessary to overlap coating layers to avoid leaving uncoated zones . 
We have sprayed the different materials using the same spraying conditions ( 20 cm of spraying distance and an 1 . 1 g / s feeding rate ) , and we have overlapped the spraying layers by 20 % . 
For this conditions the thickness of the coating for the single sprayed layer was 500 μ m ( Fig . 8a ) and due to the overlapping of layers the coating the thickness of the coating increased by 50 % to 750 μ m ( Fig . 8b ) . 
In the one layer coating the porosity was distributed all across the thickness of the layer , while when two layers were deposited the porosity almost disappeared in the inner and central part of the coating . 
This is an effect of the mechanical impact of the particles sprayed in the second layer , which was favoured by the higher temperature of the coating reached during the second spraying . 
This implied a higher thermoplastic response of the ﬁ rst and second coatings which allowed reducing their porosity . 
Porosity reduced by about 30 % by spraying two layers ( Fig . 9a ) and the reinforcement rates were up to 45 % higher ( Fig . 9b ) , as compared with spraying only one layer . 
This can be explained because SiCp cannot directly adhere to the substrate , so the ﬁ rst layer acted as bond coat easing the formation and adhesion of a highly reinforced coating . There is also a preheating effect of the ﬁ rst coating that favours the adhesion of the SiCp . 
In all cases , hardness increased in the two layer system because of the reinforcement rate increase and porosity reduction ( Fig . 10 ) , showing the same dependence with the powder mixtures used as indicated in previous sections . 
The spraying distance is generally considered as one of the clue parameters to obtain dense coatings . 
We have observed in the transversal sections that the outer part of the coatings was better consolidated for the layer sprayed at the largest distance ( Fig . 11b ) than at shorter ones ( Fig . 11a and c ) . 
There was a reduction in the porosity from 1 . 9 % to under 0 . 75 % for coatings sprayed at 16 cm and 20 cm , respectively ( Fig . 12a ) , obtaining porosity values that are lower than those obtained with other techniques [ 6 – 8 ] . 
On the other hand , the spraying distance did not have in ﬂ uence in the reinforcement rates of the coatings ( Fig . 12b ) . 
The hardness values obtained for the 20 % SiCs – g sprayed at the largest distance were higher than for the other conditions ( Fig . 12c ) . This can be explained by the melting of the sprayed coating that took place during the spraying at the shortest distance , which allowed the formation of big spherical pores formed by trapped gases and to its slow cooling ( Fig . 11c ) , and by the favoured reactivity of the sol – gel coating with the Al – Si alloy . 
One of the key features of thermal spraying is that it can be usually considered as a nearly cold technique , i . e . that the input heat can be controlled to avoid modifying the structure of the substrates . In the case of spraying on low melting temperature substrates , such as aluminium alloys , this cannot be easily assumed because temperatures above 300 ° C can be reached , causing thermal ageing of the substrate . 
We used the AA6082 with a T6 treatment , i . e . solubilised at 530 ° C and arti ﬁ cially aged for 8 h at 176 ° C , with a hardness of 109 HV . 
The hardness measured in the substrate after the spraying procedure for the same spraying distance of 18 cm are plot in Fig . 13 . 
The hardness test was made across the transversal section at four distances from the coating for each material and condition tested . 
The hardness of the substrates was homogenous in all zones ( scattering of results was less than 6 % ) , indicating that the samples suffered the same thermal treatment because of the high thermal conductivity of aluminium . 
The softer substrates were obtained after spraying the unreinforced material ; increasing the proportion of particles in the feeding mixture or reducing the powder feeding rate reduced the hardness loss suffered by the samples . 
Finally , depositing two layers was the spraying condition that most reduced the hardness of the substrates . 
All these phenomena have the same origin ; the hardness was lost by an overaging of the hardening Mg2Si precipitates formed during the arti ﬁ cial ageing of the samples , which grows with the increase of input heat to the substrate . 
Therefore , the highest the ef ﬁ ciency of the heat transferred from the spraying gun to the sample , the highest the reduction of hardness caused by means of the thermal treatment applied . 
The aluminium powder absorbs more heat than the SiC particles and transfers it more ef ﬁ ciently to the substrate , causing the highest hardness reduction in the coatings deposited without SiCp ; a similar phenomenon took place when higher powder feeding rates were used . 
Obviously , applying two layers meant a higher input heat to the substrate . 
Aluminium matrix composite coatings with an Al – 11Si matrix and SiC particles reinforcement have been successfully prepared by oxyacetylene thermal spraying on aluminium alloy substrates ; the effect of the main spraying parameters on the characteristics of the coatings and the optimum spraying conditions have been determined . 
During the spraying a part of the SiCp from the feeding mixture was lost , and the coatings had reinforcement rates of about 16 vol . % when the spraying mixture contained 20 vol . % of SiCp and 27 vol . % when spraying mixtures with 40 vol . % SiCp . 
When the mixture feeding rate was increased , the reinforcement degree and the porosity increased . 
Reducing the spraying distance caused an increase in the porosity of the layer because of an excessive input heat , but it did not affect the reinforcement degree of the coating . 
The reinforcement degree obtained after depositing two layers was higher than after one because of the favoured adherence of SiCp to aluminium splats than to the aluminium alloy substrate and by the preheating effect of the ﬁ rst layer deposited . 
The porosity obtained was also lower after the application of the second layer . 
In all conditions studied , using sol – gel silica coatings on SiCp reduced the porosity of the coatings to values below 1 % because it enhanced the wettability of the reinforcement by molten aluminium , and also increased the degree of reinforcement of the coatings obtained . 
The spraying treatment modi ﬁ ed the properties of the 6082 - T6 aluminium alloy used as substrate because of the input heat , leading to the loss of the T6 condition . 
To reduce this effect , the use of low feeding rates , mixtures with high SiCp percentages and depositing only one layer is recommended . 
However , the size of the substrate sample has a critical in ﬂ uence in the heat transfer conditions of the technique , so it must be optimized for each practical application . 
Title : Effect of Cu and Mg on the wear properties of spray formed Al - 22Si alloy 
In the present study , the effect of Cu and Mg on the wear behavior of spray formed Al - 22Si alloy has been investigated and the same has been compared with that of its counterpart as - cast alloy . 
Al - 22Si and Al – 22Si – 4Cu – 1 . 7Mg alloys prepared by spray deposition process were hot pressed to reduce the porosity . 
The microstructures were examined by optical and scanning electron microscopes . 
The microstructure of spray formed Al - 22Si alloy is fine and homogeneous and primary silicon phase distributed in the aluminum matrix evenly are fine and faceted having a mean size of 12 µ m . 
The microstructure of spray formed Al – 22Si – 4Cu – 1 . 7Mg alloy exhibited equiaxed grain morphology with fine and uniform distribution of both primary and eutectic Si with fine Q - Al - Si - Mg - Cu phase and θ - Al2Cu precipitates dispersed evenly in α Al matrix . 
In contrast the microstructure of as - cast Al – 22Si alloy consisted of coarse plates of primary Si of size 350 µ m and eutectic Si needles . 
The as - cast Al – 22Si – 4Cu – 1 . 7Mg alloy consisted of coarse primary Si with Chinese script like θ - Al2Cu precipitates and needles of Q - AlSi - Mg - Cu phase in α - Al matrix . 
The wear study of both as - cast and spray formed and hot pressed alloys under an applied load of 10 to 50 N and sliding velocity of 0 . 4 to1 . 5 ms - 1 indicated two distinct regimes of mild and severe wear . In both the regimes , the spray - formed and hot pressed alloys consistently indicated a low wear rate compared to that of as - cast alloys . The high wear resistance of spray formed and hot pressed Al – 22Si and Al – 22Si – 4Cu – 1 . 7Mg alloys were explained in the light of their microstructural modifications induced during spray forming and subsequent hot pressing . 
The chemical composition of Al – 22Si and Al – 22Si – 4Cu – 1 . 7Mg alloys is shown in Table 1 . The details of spray forming set up employed in the present study have been described elsewhere [ Day13 ] . 
In brief , spray forming process employed an annular convergent - divergent nozzle to create a spray of the melt . 
In each run 2 . 5 kg of alloy has been melted to a superheat temperature of 150 ° C in a resistance heating furnace . 
The molten metal is atomized by a free fall atomizer using N2 gas . 
The resultant spray is deposited over a Cu substrate resulting in a near net shaped preform . 
The process variables employed for producing the preforms are listed in Table 2 . Specimens of size 100 x 30 x 20 mm were cut from the preforms . 
The specimens were hot pressed at a pressure of 55 MPa and a temperature of 480 ° C for densification . 
The density of spray formed alloys was measured by using Archimedes principle as per ASTM : B962 – 08 . The percentage of porosity ( % P ) in the spray formed alloys was measured by using the actual density ( ρ ac ) and the theoretical density ( ρ th ) of the alloys using the relation , % P = [ 1 - ( ρ ac / ρ th ) ] x 100 . The samples were prepared by polishing using standard metallographic techniques of grinding on emery paper with 1 / 0 , 2 / 0 , 3 / 0 and 4 / 0 specifications and cloth polishing . 
The polished samples were etched with Keller ’ s reagent ( 1 % vol . HF , 1 . 5 % vol . HCl , 2 . 5 % vol . HNO3 and rest water ) . The microstructures of the samples were examined under a ZEISS Optical Microscope and Scanning Electron Microscopy ( S - 3400N Hitachi Model ) . The hardness measurement was carried out using Vickers Hardness Tester ( Mattoon ATK - 600 ) at an applied load of 300g . 
Wear tests were conducted on all the alloy specimens on a pin - on - disc wear testing machine ( Model : TR20 , DUCOM ) as per ASTM : G99 - 05 . 
The counterpart disc was made of quenched and tempered EN - 32 steel having a surface hardness of 65HRC . 
Wear specimens of size Ø 8 × 30 mm were machined out from both the alloys . 
The specimens were polished and then cleaned with acetone before conducting the wear test . 
The wear tests were conducted by varying load from 10 – 50 N at a sliding velocity of 1 . 5 ms - 1 and a sliding distance of 1025 m . 
Similarly the sliding velocity of the disc was varied from 0 . 4 to 1 . 4 ms - 1 at a constant applied load of 50 N . 
All the experiments were carried out under dry sliding conditions and data was recorded at room temperature . 
The worn surfaces of both the alloys after wear testing were examined under Scanning Electron Microscopy .

The presence of fine , spherical porosity of 15 . 2 % has been observed in the spray formed alloy . 
Fig . 4 ( a ) shows the SEM / EDS micrograph of spray deposited Al - 22Si alloy . 
It can be seen from the micrograph that the alloy exhibited the primary Si particulates and fine eutectic Si phase which are uniformly distributed in Al - matrix . 
The EDS results of various phases present in the spray deposited alloy is shown in Table 5 . 
The SEM / EDS micrograph of spray deposited Al22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy is shown in the Fig . 4 ( b ) . 
The microstructure of alloy exhibited coexisting faceted primary Si particles and fine plates of complex intermetallic phases . 
The size of Si particles varied from 3 to 20 µ m compared to large particle size of 150 µ m in as - cast alloy . The various phases present are grey colored Si particulates as a major element , grey colored intermetallic Q - Al48Si29Mg18Fe4 phase and bright white phase of θ - Al2Cu . 
The EDS results of various phases present in the spray deposited alloy is shown in Table 6 . 
Fig . 5 shows the X - ray images of spray formed Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy . 
This reveals the presence of Si , Cu and Mg elements which are uniformaly distributed in the spray formed alloy and is well corroborated with EDS results . 
The optical microstructure of spray formed and hot pressed Al - 22Si alloy is shown in Fig . 6 ( a ) . 
This exhibits the fragmentation of primary Si particles , eutectic Si phase , significantly reduced porosity level of 5 . 4 % and increased volume fraction of Si phase . 
Fig . 6 ( b ) shows the optical micrograph of spray formed and hot pressed Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy . 
It can be observed from the Fig . 6 ( b ) that there is a fragmentation of Si and brittle θ and Q intermetallics and porosity has been reduced to 3 . 8 % . 
The solidification of as - cast Al - 22Si and Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloys , due to slow cooling rate and broad temperature interval between the liquidus and solidus of higher Si content composite in the pseudo binary section will cause castings with a coarse plate like Si , needle like Q and Chinese script like Al2Cu phases . 
In spray forming process , the solidification phenomena changes due to the effect of high cooling rate during the atomization stage and the unique microstructural evolution mechanism after deposition . 
The fine uniform distribution of primary Si particles and eutectic Si phase and equiaxed morphology of the α - Al phase are remarkable features of spray deposited hypereutectic Al - Si alloy . 
These features are due to the relatively high cooling rate ( 103 - 106 Ks - 1 ) associated with repeated deformation and extensive fragmentation of partially solidified droplets during the build - up of the deposit which could effectively alter the morphological stability of the Si phase [ Sri01 ] . 
As the cooling rate increases during atomization , the droplets experience a large undercooling prior to nucleation of primary Si phase leading to refinement . 
Simultaneously , reduced temperature suppresses the growth of these phases even after the deposition [ Gra95 ] . 
Thus , large amount of fine and uniformly distributed Si and greater number of precipitates ( Al2Cu phase , Q phase ) are seen in the spray formed Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy . 
The dendritic as well as the Chinese script structures observed in the as - cast alloys are modified and it is difficult to discern the difference between primary Al2Cu and Q phases . 
The porosity has been observed in the deposits and was uniformly distributed . 
The spherical morphology and non - connected distribution of the pores suggest that their formation occurred due to the incorporation of gas , a well - described phenomenon caused by an excessive presence of liquid during the spray formation [ Cai98 ] . 
Hot pressing of spray formed alloys led to a considerable reduction in porosity and recrystallization of microstructure to a certain extent . 
The preheating treatment before compression process can make the microstructure more uniform . 
Secondly , hot deformation leads to a microstructural refinement and a solid - state phase transformation . 
The severe stress imposed by hot compression generates high density dislocations in the grains . 
Subsequently , the movement and arrangement of dislocations form lot of small angle grain - boundaries , refining initial grains into several substructures . 
In addition to the refinement of grains , hot deformation also promotes homogeneous precipitation of hardening of θ and Q phases which can pin the movement of dislocations to restrain grains coarsening during recrystallization effectively [ Est90 ] . 
The results of hardness measurement of spray formed + hot pressed ( SF + HP ) Al - 22Si and Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloys are as shown in the Table 7 . 
It is observed from the results that a significant increase in the microhardness of SF + HP alloys takes place compared to as - cast alloys . The SF + HP Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy exhibits higher hardness compared to Al - 22Si alloy . The increase in the hardness of spray formed + hot pressed Al - 22Si alloy is due to the presence of fine and uniform distribution of Si particles in Al - matrix as well as reduction of porosity . 
It may be noted that an increase in the volume fraction of the Si particles will lead to higher constraint in the localized deformation of softer matrix under the application of indentation load . 
The fine primary Si and eutectic Si phases provide an appreciable impediment to plastic deformation caused by the indentation . 
The higher hardness of spray formed + hot pressed Al - 22Si - 4Cu1 . 7Mg alloy can be atributed to the presence of fine and uniform distribution of brittle intermetallic θ - Al2Cu and Q phases in addition to fine primary Si particles [ Sha07 , Hau09 ] . 
Variation in the wear rate of both the AC and SF + HP alloys as a function of applied load at constant sliding velocity of 1 . 5ms - 1 is shown in Fig . 7 . 
Wear rate of both as - cast and SF + HP alloys increases with increasing normal load . 
Comparative study of wear behavior of two alloys shows that SF + HP alloys are subjected to lower wear rate than as - cast alloys under identical sliding conditions . 
In the entire range of applied load , the SF + HP Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy exhibited best wear resistance . 
Fig . 8 shows the effect of sliding velocity on the wear rate of the alloys . 
It is worthwhile to note that the wear rate initially decreases with increasing sliding velocity . 
With further increase in the sliding velocity beyond the critical limit , the wear rate increases irrespective of alloy condition and composition . 
It is observed from the variation of wear rate with sliding velocity that the spray formed alloys show less wear rate than as - cast alloys . 
Minimum wear rate is observed in SF + HP Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy . 
Fig . 9 depicts the variation of coefficient of friction of Al - 22Si and Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloys . 
It can be seen that initially , the coefficient of friction decreased with increasing load and found to be constant in all the alloys with further increase in load . 
The spray formed and hot pressed alloys indicate lowest coefficient of friction , whereas the highest friction coefficients occurred in the as - cast alloys . 
The different wear characteristics of spray formed alloys are related to their microstructural features . 
The wear behavior of hypereutectic Al - Si alloys has been reported in several recent investigations [ Dhe06 , Cla79 , Pra87 , Sas92 , Raj12 ] . 
In general , the size and shape of Si particles and the nature of dispersion of second phase particles in the matrix have been observed to have a strong influence on the wear rate of a wide range of materials . 
In the present work , the spray - formed and hot pressed alloys exhibit an uniform distribution of fine Si particles and distribution of hard intermetallics ( Q - phase ) and θ - Al2Cu precipitates have a large influence on the dry sliding wear behavior of alloys [ Haq01 ] . These features of the spray formed alloy are attributed to strong bonds at the matrix - particle interface due to the decrease in the particle size and the consequent microstructural stability of the alloy under a range of applied loads and sliding velocities . 
The block like Si particles , long needles of intermetallic Q - phase and coarse θ - Al2Cu phase appear to have played an important role in aggravating the wear process in as - cast alloy . 
The sharp edges of Si particles and intermetallic Q - phase may have acted as crack nucleation sites resulting in a stress concentration that is more severe at the interface between the tip of needle - like intermetallic Q - phase and the Al – matrix that led to the fracture of long needles of Q - phase resulting in a high wear rate in ascast alloy . 
The reduction in porosity , recrystallization and fragmentation of Q - phase and Al2Cu phase , their uniform distribution in the matrix of spray formed and hot pressed alloy , decrease the stress concentration between the fine needles of Q - phase and the matrix and increase the strength of matrix due to fine dispersion of Al2Cu , resulting in an improved wear resistance . 
At low loads , more time is available for the formation and growth of micro - welds , which increases the force needed to shear - off the micro - welds to keep the relative motion and this leads to an increase in wear resistance . 
An increase in the load results in the rise of the interface temperature that engenders oxidation and thermal softening of material . 
The brittle and discrete oxide film is harmful because it acts as a hard impurity or third body between mating surfaces [ Ana09 ] . 
The wear rate with normal load shows a linear relation up to the load of 40 N . 
Further increase in the load to 50 N shows an abrupt increase in wear rate indicating a change in the wear mechanism . 
At high loads , the thermal softening of the alloy in the sub surface region takes place leading to a large scale plastic deformation [ Moh96 ] . 
Under such conditions , metallic wear takes place . 
The remarkable observation in the present study is that the fine distribution of Si , intermetallic phases and good interfacial bonding at the interface with the matrix provided by the fine precipitates of θ - Al2Cu , allows for high temperature stability leading to a low wear rate in SF + HP Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy compared to SF + HP Al - 22Si alloy . 
The dispersoids of intermetallics phase in Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy possess higher hardness compared to that of eutectic Si phase in Al - 22Si alloy . 
The low melting constituent of eutectic Si is smeared out on mating surfaces at an early stage . 
This effect arises due to small interparticle spacings of dispersoids in spray - formed Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy . 
Consequently , a thin oxide layer is developed on the surface of wear test specimen which protects the materials from further wear . 
The low wear rate of SF + HP Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy justifies this mechanism . 
However , the stability of the oxide layer on the specimen surface depends on applied load and sliding velocity of the mating surfaces . 
The experimental result indicates that the stability regime of the oxidation film is extended to higher load and sliding velocity in the mild wear regime of the SF + HP alloys . 
However , as the sliding velocity is further increased , instability arises in the continuity of the oxidation layer . 
This is indicated by a significantly high wear rate of the material with further increase in the sliding velocity . 
Still in this severe wear regime , the SF + HP alloys , owing to the uniformly distributed Si and small inter particle spacing of its fine Si particles and intermetallics , continues to provide a relatively low wear rate compared to the as - cast alloys . 
Fig . 10 ( a ) shows the worn surfaces of as - cast Al - 22Si alloy . 
The surface is characterized by grooves running from one end to the other end of the surface . 
Large and heavy scoring marks with dimples are present on the surface . 
The worn tracks and surface damages like microgrooves , craters and abrasive scoring marks were also clearly observable . 
Detailed examination of the wear tracks revealed features associated with abrasive and delamination mechanism . 
The abrasive component of the wear mechanism is pointed out by the plough grooves inside the wear tracks due to the harder silicon particles scratching over the softer ( pin ) surface . 
Additionally , the delamination wear component can be concluded from the cracks and shallow craters , which are seen at the worn surface . 
Some large dimples can also be seen on the worn surface of the alloy , it indicates that block - like primary Si phases were fractured and broken off during wear . 
Fig . 10 ( b ) shows the worn surface of SF + HP Al - 22Si alloy . 
The grooves depicted on the worn surface are shallow and uniform . 
The surface clearly shows a smooth and fine scoring marks and without any pits and dimples that obviously leads to a low wear rate . 
The SEM micrographs of worn surfaces of Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloys are shown in Fig . 11 . 
The worn surface of as - cast alloy shown in Fig . 11 ( a ) consists of ploughing marks and a large number of pits indicating a high wear rate . 
The heavy damage may be due to the presence of long needles of Q - phase and coarse θ - Al2Cu phase and their uneven distribution in the alloy . 
It seems that the coarse phases are readily fractured and broken off during wear weakening the matrix leading to a high wear rate . 
In contrast , the worn surface of spray formed + hot pressed alloy shown in Fig . 11 ( b ) consists of light scoring marks and shallow dimples in one or two regions clearly indicating a low wear rate . 
This may be due to the refinement in the microstructure where the Q - phase and θ - Al2Cu phase have been finely divided and uniformly distributed in the matrix . 
This fine dispersion provides strength to the matrix and the bonding between these phases and the matrix is strong enough to retain them to the matrix during wear leading to a low wear rate [ Wan04 ] . 
Spray forming is effective in refining the microstructures of Al - 22Si and Al - 22Si - 5Cu1 . 7Mg alloys . 
The spray deposited Al - 22Si alloys exhibited fine and uniform distribution of primary Si and eutectic Si phases and equiaxial morphology of α - Al phase . 
The microstructure of spray formed Al - 22Si - 5Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy exhibited fine and uniform distribution of both primary and eutectic Si with small needles of Q - intermetallics and θ - Al2Cu precipitates spread around the boundaries and junctions of grains in α - Al matrix . 
Hot pressing of spray - formed alloys leads to reduction in porosity , grain recovery and recrystallization to certain extent . 
The spray formed and hot pressed alloys show maximum hardness compared to as - cast alloys . 
The spray formed and hot pressed Al - 22Si - 5Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy showed maximum hardness compared to other alloys . 
Wear rate of spray formed Al - 22Si - 5Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy is lower than that of Al - 22Si alloy under identical sliding conditions . 
This is because of the presence of fine intermetallics in the former alloy . 
The wear rate of both as - cast and spray formed alloys initially decreases with increase in sliding speed up to a critical speed and then increases but the wear rate is high for as - cast Al - 22Si alloy and low for spray formed and hot pressed Al - 22Si - 5Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy . 
Title : Effect of Fe and Mn additions on microstructure and mechanical properties of spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy . 
Spray deposition is a novel process which is used to manufacture rapidly solidified bulk and near - net - shape preforms . 
In this paper , Al – 20Si – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy was prepared by spray deposition technique . 
The effect of Fe and Mn additions on microstructure and mechanical properties of spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy was investigated . 
The results show that two kinds of intermetallics , i . e . δ - Al4FeSi2 and β - Al5FeSi , is formed in the microstructure of spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy . 
With additions of 5 % Fe and 3 % Mn to Al – 20Si – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy , the needle shape of Al – Si – Fe intermetallic phases is substituted by the particle shape of Al15 ( FeMn ) 3Si2 phases . 
The presence of the intermetallic phases ( δ - Al4FeSi2 , β - Al5FeSi and Al15 ( FeMn ) 3Si2 ) improves the tensile strengths of the alloy efficiently at both the room and elevated temperatures ( 300 ° C ) . 
In Table 1 are listed the chemical compositions of the alloys . 
The spray deposition experiments were conducted in an environmental chamber . 
During spray - deposition process , the molten metal was atomized by N 2 at 800 ° C , the distance of atomizing deposition was kept constant at 400 mm . 
The preform , after being cut into cylindrical billets was extruded at a temperature of 400 ° C with a reduction ratio of 10 : 1 and a ram speed of 5 mm / s . 
After extrusion , the materials were cooled in air . 
In this study , a commercially used scheme of heat treatment for the alloy was applied , which involved solution treating at 470 ° C for 1 . 5 h followed by water quenching , and artificial ageing at 120 ° C for 24 h . 
The microstructures of spray - deposited materials were characterized using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) attached with energy dispersive X - ray analyses ( EDX ) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and X - ray diffraction . 
A S360 type scanning electron microscopy working at 15 kV was used to observe the microstructures . 
The scanning electron microscopy samples were prepared using standard metallographic techniques and were etched using Keller ' s reagent . The transmission electron microscopy studies were conducted on a H - 800 type transmission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV . 
The X - ray diffraction experiments were performed on a Japan Rigaku diffractormeter using Cu - K α radiation . 
The room and elevated temperature tensile tests were conducted with an Instron tensile testing machine at an initial strain rate of 0 . 5 s − 1 . 
The elevated temperature tensile tests were conducted at 573 K at the same initial strain rate . 
Fig . 1 ( a ) shows the typical scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) microstructure of the spray - deposited A 0 alloy , which is composed of the aluminum matrix and the silicon phase mostly with a particle shape . 
The presence of eutectic Al – Si phase and coarse , block primary Si phase in the conventionally processed ingot metallurgy ( IM ) counterpart was suppressed . 
With the addition of 5 % Fe to the Al – 20Si – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy , a high volume fraction of needle - shaped intermetallic was formed after spray deposition , as can be seen in Fig . 1 ( b ) . 
The intermetallic phases with a platelet shape were determined to be the Al – Si – Fe compound by energy dispersive X - ray analyses ( EDX ) analysis . 
Fig . 1 ( c ) shows the scanning electron microscopy microstructure of the spray - deposited A 2 alloy . 
By comparing it with Fig . 1 ( b ) , it can be easily seen that the intermetallic phases with a platelet shape were suppressed , and a high volume fraction of particle - like compound was formed in the microstructure . 
EDX was used to check the composition of the intermetallic phases with a particle shape , it showed that the particle - like compound contains Al , Si , Fe and Mn . 
Fig . 2 shows the X - ray diffraction ( XRD ) patterns of the spray - deposited alloys . 
XRD was performed to identify second phases , and analysis of the diffraction patterns shows that the intermetallic phases mainly are δ - Al 4 FeSi 2 and β - Al 5 FeSi compounds in the A 1 alloy , and the particle - like compounds are Al 15 ( FeMn ) 3 Si 2 phases in the A 2 alloy . 
Fig . 3 ( a ) shows the transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) photograph of the intermetallic phases with a platelet shape in the microstructure of spray - deposited A 1 alloy . 
Energy dispersive X - ray analysis showed that the phase contains elements of Al , Si and Fe , and this phase being identified as δ - Al4FeSi2 compound with tetragonal parameters of a = 0 . 609 nm and c = 0 . 944 nm using electron diffraction , as can be 
seen in Fig . 3 ( b ) . 
Fig . 4 ( a ) shows the transmission electron microscopy photograph of another intermetallic phases with a platelet shape in the microstructure of spray - deposited A 1 alloy . 
Indexing of the selected area diffraction patterns indicates that the needle - like phases are β - Al 5 FeSi compounds with monoclinic parameters of a = b = 0 . 612 nm and c = 4 . 15 nm , as can be seen in Fig . 4 ( b ) . 
The transmission electron microscopy results are in good agreement with the X - ray diffraction ones , as shown in Fig . 2 . 
Fig . 5 ( a ) shows the transmission electron microscopy micrograph of spray - deposited A 2 alloy , it can be seen that some particles are distributed in the matrix of the microstructure , the resultant spectra from Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy ( EDS ) indicate the phase contains elements of Al , Si , Fe and Mn . 
Fig . 5 ( b ) shows a selected area diffraction pattern of the particle - like intermetallc that being identified as Al 15 ( FeMn ) 3 Si 2 . 
Spray - deposited alloys were subjected to tensile testing at room and elevated temperature after extrusionand heat treatment . 
Table 2 summarizes the tensile test results . 
It is worth noting that the tensile strengths of the A 1 and A 2 alloy for T6 condition are much higher than of the A 0 alloy at room temperature . 
Obviously , the intermetallics play an important role for the increasing of the tensile strength . 
From Table 2 , with additions of 5 % Fe to Al – 20Si – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy , both the yield and ultimate tensile strengths was increased 55 and 64 MPa at room temperature , respectively . 
The reason may be that a lot of dispersion - strengthened intermetallics , such as δ - Al 4 FeSi 2 and β - Al 5 FeSi , distributed in the matrix , they can prevent dislocation moving , and enhance strength of the alloy at room temperature . 
With addition of 3 % Mn to Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy , the variation of the tensile properties at room temperature was not remarkable . 
However , 3 % Mn addition leads to a substantial improvement of the tensile strengths at elevated temperature . 
This reflects the additional strengthening effects of fine particle dispersion and retained substructure contributed by the Al 15 ( FeMn ) 3 Si 2 particles , which serve as extra obstacles to dislocation gliding . 
The dispersion of the thermally stable Al 15 ( FeMn ) 3Si 2 particles , in combination with their inhibition to growth of the grains occurring at elevated temperature , is considered to be the key to the enhanced hot strength of the alloy . 
The microstructure of spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy is composed of the Al matrix and particulate - like Si phase . With addition of 5 % Fe to Al – 20Si – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy , two kinds of intermetallics , i . e . δ - Al 4 FeSi 2 and β - Al 5 FeSi , is formed in the microstructure . 
With additions of 5 % Fe and 3 % Mn to Al – 20Si – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy , the needle shape of Al – Si – Fe intermetallic phases is substituted by the particle shape of Al 15 ( FeMn ) 3 Si 2 phases . 
The tensile test results indicate that spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy has better strength than the Al – 20Si – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy at both the room and elevated temperature ( 573 K ) due to the presence of δ - Al 4 FeSi 2 and β - Al 5 FeSi intermetallics . 
The tensile properties of the spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Mn – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy are superior to the Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1 Mg alloy at elevated temperature . 
Title : Microstructural characterisation of spray formed Si – 30Al for thermal management applications 
This paper presents a study of the microstructure of a spray formed Si – 30 wt . % Al alloy used in electronic packaging applications . 
The microstructure consisted of ~ 5 μ m equiaxed primary Si grains and a coarse grained Al - rich phase with occasional regions of ~ 10 μ m equiaxed Al - rich grains interpenetrating the Si network with no evidence of a lamellar Al – Si eutectic . 
This unusual microstructure arose because of the particular solidi ﬁ cation conditions during and immediately after the spray forming process and the large alloy freezing range . 
The increasing power and density of modern avionic and satellite electronics demands e ffi cient heat dissipation to prevent the premature failure of semiconductor devices [ 1 ] . 
Failure rates increase dramatically as device temperature increases : typically for every 10 ℃ temperature rise , the lifetime of a GaAs or Si semiconductor device is reduced by a factor of three [ 2 ] . 
Heat dissipation and cooling is usually achieved by the use of heat sinks , heat spreaders and packaging materials [ 3 ] . 
Ideal thermal management materials have a coe ffi cient of thermal expansion ( CTE ) of 7 – 9x10 - ^ 6 ℃ - ^ 1 closely matched to GaAs or Si , high thermal conductivity of > 100 W / m K and a low density of < 3 g cm - ^ 3 , especially for transport applications . 
Hypereutectic Al - high Si alloys possess a combination of physical properties that make them attractive for thermal management applications , including the required relatively high thermal conductivity , low density , and a linear variation in CTE with temperature [ 4 , 5 ] . 
The proportion of Al to Si in these alloys determines the alloy CTE and can be tailored in the range 7 – 17x10 - ^ 6 ℃ - ^ 1 to speci ﬁ c thermal management applications , such as Al2O3 circuit boards or GaAs semiconductor devices [ 6 ] . 
Further advantages include : high speci ﬁ c sti ff ness , laser and electron beam weldability , platability with Au or Cu , and good RF screening [ 2 ] . 
To prevent cracking and poor integrity found in conventionally cast Al - high Si alloys , spray forming [ 7 ] has been developed for the manufacture of bulk Si – Al alloys with Si concentrations up to 70 wt . % . 
This paper presents a detailed study of the microstructure of a spray formed Si – 30 wt . % Al alloy , showing for the ﬁ rst time key microstructural features in both the primary Si and secondary Al - rich phases . 
A 26 kg Si – 30 wt . % Al billet ( all compositions in wt . % ) , termed SFSi30Al , was manufactured by spray forming at Sandvik - Osprey Metals Ltd . 
An Al – 30Si master alloy was induction melted , pure polycrystalline Si was added , and at ~ 1450 ℃ ( 200 ℃ superheat ) , the melt was poured into a conical tundish which fed a ceramic melt delivery nozzle . 
The melt was atomised using a two stage , scanning atomiser operating with N2 gas . 
The trajectory of the resulting droplets comprising the spray was intercepted by a ceramic collector plate manipulated within the spray cone to build - up progressively a coherent billet [ 6 , 7 ] . 
Full manufacturing details are proprietary . 
Once spraying was complete , the still semi - solid billet was removed from the spray chamber , insulated and then force cooled from the base of the billet [ 5 ] to concentrate any shrinkage porosity in the top of the billet , which was then scalped . 
The billet was hot isostatically pressed ( HIPed ) close to the binary Al – Si eutectic temperature of 577 ℃ to reduce any residual porosity to < 0 . 1 vol . % . 
The resulting microstructure was investigated using a combination of : ( i ) optical microscopy ; ( ii ) electron probe microanalysis ( EPMA ) in a JEOL JXA 8800 superprobe ; ( iii ) electron backscatter di ff raction ( EBSD ) with simultaneous energy dispersive X - ray spectroscopy ( EDS ) in a JEOL 6500 ﬁ eld emission gun - scanning electron microscope ; and ( iv ) X - ray di ff raction ( XRD ) tilting experiments using a Nonius powder di ff raction system with an Inel curved position sensitive detector , Cu Ka1 radiation and a Ge h1 1 1i monochromator . 
In the XRD studies , the sample was rotated with the angle relative to the beam ﬁ xed and ﬁ ve data sets collected with the sample tilted at approximately 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 . 
For EBSD studies , the sample was tilted to 70 . 5 and analysed with a high beam current ( typically 100 nA ) using an accelerating voltage of 20 keV at a working distance of ~ 15 mm . 
Proprietary EDAX TSL OIM data acquisition and analysis software was used and simultaneously acquired EDS information allowed the data from the Al and Si - rich phases to be partitioned and investigated separately . 
Figure 1 shows optical micrographs of spray formed and HIPed Si – 30Al ( SFSi30Al ) and an as - cast Si – 30Al alloy for comparison . 
Figure 1 ( a ) shows the microstructure of SFSi30Al consisted of a continuous network of globular primary Si and an interpenetrating secondary ‘ ductilising ’ Al - rich phase , in contrast to the much larger acicular primary phase and coarse ﬂ ake eutectic in the as - cast microstructure in Figure 1 ( b ) . 
The spray formed material exhibited no Al – Si lamellar eutectic in inter - Si regions , and instead these regions consisted of a single Al - rich phase only , with a typical Si concentration of ~ 0 . 2 % and impurity concentrations for Fe , Cu , Ti , Zr of 0 . 2 % , 0 . 03 % , 0 . 04 % , and 0 . 02 % , respectively as determined by EPMA . 
Interspersed through this Al - rich phase were occasional intermetallic particles that EPMA showed to contain predominantly either Al – Fe – Si or Si – Ti – Zr . 
Figure 2 ( a ) shows an EBSD orientation map for Si only with the surface of the sample parallel to the billet axial direction and where Si - rich and Al - rich phases have been identi ﬁ ed and partitioned on the basis of simultaneously acquired EDS data . 
The Si grains were equiaxed with a mean grain size of ~ 5 μ m and contained approximately 25 % by number of coherent R3 60  / h1 1 1i twin boundaries . 
The corresponding { 0 0 1 } pole ﬁ gure ( PF ) for Si shown in Figure 2 ( b ) indicated no preferred orientation . 
Figure 3 shows a lower magni ﬁ cation EBSD orientation map of a di ff erent area for the Al - rich phase only . The Al - rich phase consisted of 250 – 300 lm regions containing grains with a narrow spread of crystallographic orientations . 
Figure 3 ( b ) and ( c ) show the corresponding { 0 0 1 } PF and inverse pole ﬁ gures ( IPF ) respectively indicating that the h0 0 1i direction was aligned approximately with the spray formed billet axis to within 15 . Although this ﬁ nding suggests that the Al - rich grains grew with a preferred h0 0 1i direction through the preexisting Si , other regions of the billet showed similarly sized regions in which the Al - rich grain < 1 1 0 > and h1 1 1i directions were approximately normal to the billet axial direction . 
Figure 3 ( a ) also shows smaller isolated regions of Al - rich grains , highlighted with circles , in which there was an Al - rich equiaxed grain size of ~ 10 μ m . 
As a complement to the EBSD investigations of any preferred directions in the Al - rich phase , Figure 4 shows tilting XRD experiment traces for SFSi30Al sectioned normal to the billet axial direction , at approximately half the billet height at the mid - radius position . 
The sample was tilted to bring grains to and away from the Bragg condition , allowing any crystallographic directionality to be identi ﬁ ed . 
Figure 4 shows that Al and Si phase peak intensities varied with tilt angle , indicating some preferred orientations . 
The microstructure of cast , unmodi ﬁ ed Si – 30Al consisted of coarse primary Si and inter - Si Al – Si lamellar eutectic . 
In SFSi30Al the primary Si is equiaxed and substantially re ﬁ ned with inter - Si distances ~ 30 μ m and the lamellar eutectic is suppressed . 
Insulation of the semi - solid billet immediately after spray forming leads to thermal equilibration of the billet to ~ 700 ℃ that must involve partial re - melting . 
At this temperature the billet comprises ~ 40 wt . % liquid at a composition of Al – 22 % Si [ 8 ] distributed throughout the solid primary Si network . 
Because the billet then remains insulated and cools very slowly , and there is a very high number density of Si grains arising from earlier nucleation of primary Si in the myriad of impinging droplets , the remaining Al – Si liquid solidi ﬁ es with a relatively low growth velocity V . This low V leads to the fully divorced eutectic , either because when the eutectic temperature is reached , the expected eutectic lamellar spacing k approaches the re ﬁ ned inter - Si distances of ~ 30 μ m [ 9 ] , or the facetted / non facetted solid – liquid front becomes unstable due to low V and large k [ 10 ] . 
This similarity of length scales of the stable eutectic spacing for eutectic growth at low V and the inter - Si spacing leads to Si atoms attaching to the pre - existing Si network or to the nucleation of new grains at the solid – liquid interface to act as growth sites for Si rejected from the liquid . 
The microstructures in this study suggest the former mechanism . In consequence , the residual liquid ﬁ nally solidi ﬁ ed as essentially pure a - Al containing only impurity elements in solid - solution as revealed by EPMA , and the resulting inter - Si regions are free of lamellar eutectic as reported previously for sprayformed hypoeutectic [ 12 ] and hypereutectic Al – Si alloys [ 13 , 14 ] . In order to con ﬁ rm that the similarity of the length scale of the likely eutectic spacing k at low V and the primary Si spacing was involved in the observed divorced eutectic , samples of SFSi30Al were re - heated to 700 ℃ for 1 h and then : ( a ) furnace cooled to simulate insulated post - spray cooling of the billet – low V ; ( b ) air cooled – intermediate V and ( c ) water quenched – high V , and the resulting microstructures are shown in Figure 5 ( a ) – ( c ) , respectively . 
Similarly to the as - sprayed material in Figure 1 ( a ) , the furnace cooled material in Figure 5 ( a ) had no Al – Si eutectic ; whereas the air cooled material in Figure 5 ( b ) showed ﬂ ake - like eutectic Si formation ; and the quenched sample in Figure 5 ( c ) had a very ﬁ ne ﬁ brous eutectic Si , consistent with conventional Al – Si eutectic solidi ﬁ cation [ 15 ] . 
Whereas the primary Si grain size is ~ 5 μ m , the Al - rich regions are much coarser with a length scale of 250 – 300 μ m . 
The coarser Al - rich grains can be attributed to ( a ) a much lower number density of e ffi cient a - Al nucleants in comparison with that population available from in - ﬂ ight nucleation for primary Si , and ( b ) a di ff usion - controlled coarsening constant for a - Al of ~ 10 - ^ 16 m ^ 3 s - ^ 1 that is three orders of magnitude larger than that of primary Si [ 16 – 18 ] . 
EBSD initially suggested that the Si grains were crystallographically random , however XRD tilting experiments in Figure 4 revealed the Si ( 1 1 1 ) intensity was weak relative to the other Si peaks – in a random arrangement the Si ( 1 1 1 ) peak intensity should be approximately twice that of Si ( 2 2 0 ) [ 19 ] . 
Figure 6 ( a ) shows the Si IPF obtained using EBSD from a 1750 μ m x 750 μ m area of the XRD sample corresponding to ~ 14 , 000 grains where the contours indicate the levels of crystallographic alignment . 
There is a weak peak in pole density of 1 . 16x random close to the < 1 1 2 > direction ( one of the directions normal to < 1 1 1 > ) . 
The EBSD IPF from a sample sectioned in the billet radial direction in Figure 6 ( b ) from ~ 10 , 000 grains showed a peak in pole density of 1 . 36x random close to the < 1 1 1 > orientation . 
The Si network is formed predominantly during spray forming rather than during post - spray cooling and the preferred Si < 1 1 1 > radial orientation results from Si < 1 1 1 > radial growth because radial heat ﬂ ow is dominant at the half height , midradius location where the atomising gas force cools the billet sides . 
Further growth of Si during post - spray cooling retains this orientation . 
The EBSD orientation map in Figure 3 showed a large area of Al - rich grains with a near h0 0 1i growth orientation in the billet axial direction , apparently undisturbed by the Si network though which it penetrates . 
Recognising that the Al - rich phase solidi ﬁ ed long after spray forming is complete , this orientation might be that expected as cooling from the billet base caused predominantly by axial heat ﬂ ow and < 0 0 1 > is the preferred growth direction for cubic metals . 
However , further EBSD investigations revealed that these large regions have a range of crystallographic directions and the XRD traces in Figure 4 indicated especially intense Al ( 1 1 1 ) peaks at certain tilt angles . 
EBSD investigation of a 1750 μ m x 750 μ m area of this same XRD sample con ﬁ rmed a ~ 250 μ m region oriented near to < 1 1 1 > . The occasional regions of ﬁ ne equiaxed Al grains shown in Figure 3 ( a ) are formed when either the liquid in these regions becomes isolated from the larger growing Al grains , or local compositional and undercooling conditions favour heterogeneous nucleation of new Al grains . 
A modi ﬁ ed spray forming process route has been developed for Si – Al alloys and produces a 5 μ m , equiaxed , weakly non - random oriented primary Si grain structure interpenetrated by a much coarser 250 – 300 μ m Al - rich phase containing grains with a narrow spread of orientations of ~ 15 , as well as much ﬁ ner areas with equiaxed grains at the scale of ~ 10 μ m . 
The conventional Al – Si lamellar eutectic structure was suppressed in favour of a fully divorced eutectic because of : ( i ) the myriad of solid droplets and particles from the spray process provided a high number density of Si nucleation sites and resulted in inter - Si distances < 30 μ m ; ( ii ) turbulent deposition surface conditions leading to solute sweeping and physical disruption of the solidi ﬁ cation front during spray forming ; and ( iii ) slow , post - spray solidi ﬁ cation conditions due to billet insulation , the large alloy freezing range and the relatively high latent heat associated with Si . 
Re - heating experiments supported the hypothesis that the fully divorced eutectic structure arose from a combination of the very slow cooling rate and the re ﬁ ned microstructural scale of the primary Si . 
Title : Superplastic deformation behavior of spray - deposited hyper - eutectic Al – 25Si alloy 
The mechanical properties of an Al – 25Si alloy fabricated through the spray forming route were studied in a wide range of temperatures covering from 370 to 500 ℃ and the results were compared with those for the powder - metallurgy processed Al – Si alloys studied by other investigators . 
Superplasticity was observed at high - temperatures around 500 ℃ at 5 × 10 ^ - 4 s ^ - 1 . 
The entire temperature range could be divided into two regions where grain boundary sliding and dislocation climb creep dictates plastic flow , respectively . 
The activation energies for effective plastic flow were measured in these two regions and found to be close to that for self - diffusion in pure aluminum . 
It was found that the present Al – 25Si alloy almost behaves like superplastic aluminum matrix at elevated temperatures . 
Extensive whisker formation was observed and liquidation of grain boundary material during grain boundary sliding appears to be responsible for it . 
The material used in the current investigation was prepared via spray forming . 
The chemical composition is given as Al – 25Si – 3 . 7Cu - 1Mg – 0 . 42Fe in weight percent ( hereafter , denoted as ‘ Al – 25Si alloy ’ ) . 
The detailed procedures regarding the preparation of the present alloy are discussed elsewhere [ 4 ] . 
An as - received spray - deposited billet was extruded at 450 ℃ ( ratio of 50 : 1 ) at a temperature of 430 ℃ . 
Tensile test samples with a gage length of 5 mm were machined from the extruded bar with the tensile axis parallel to the extrusion direction . 
The strain - rate change ( SRC ) test was conducted in the temperature range from 370 to 500 ℃ by increasing the crosshead speed . 
Prestrain of 10 % was given at the cross - head speed corresponding to a nominal strain rate of 10 ^ 2 s ^ - 1 and a strain of 3 % was imposed subsequently at each interval of cross - head speed . 
Elongation - to - failure tests were conducted under constant cross - head speed condition . 
The microstructural characterization before and after the elongation - to - failure tests was examined by using optics and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) . 
The compositions of whiskers and flow lines developed on grain surfaces and the fractured surface of specimens were determined by energy - dispersive X - ray spectrometry ( EDS ) . 
Differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) was conducted at a heating rate of 10 ℃ / min to determine the initial melting temperature of the present alloy . 
It was found to be 563 ℃ . 
A typical photograph showing a microstructural morphology of the present alloy obtained after extrusion is shown in Fig . 1 . 
The aluminum - matrix grains ( white color ) are equiaxed and fine , and have a fairly wide size distribution ranging from 2 to 15 μ m . 
The linear intercept grain size was determined as 8 μ m . 
Silicon particles ( gray color ) whose size is also in a wide range between 2 and 10 μ m are observed to be uniformly distributed over the Al matrix . 
Fig . 2 shows the elongation - to - failure test results as a function of strain rate at three temperatures in a range between 475 and 515 ℃ . 
A maximum tensile elongation of ~ 250 % was obtained at 5 × 10 ^ - 4 s ^ - 1 and at 500 ℃ . 
This value of tensile elongation is larger than ~ 150 % recorded in the PM Al – 25Si alloy [ 1 , 2 ] , but the strain rate associated with the maximum tensile elongation is lower than that for the PM Al – 25Si alloy ( 10 ^ - 2 s ^ - 1 ) . 
This decrease in the optimum strain rate should be attributed to the larger grain size of the present alloy , compared to that of the PM Al – 25Si alloy ( ~ 2 μ m ) . 
The relationship between strain rate and stress in a log – log plot at various temperatures between 370 and 500 ℃ is shown in Fig . 3 . 
At this temperature interval , the slope of the curve , representing the value of apparent stress exponent , na , varies with strain rate . 
A typical sigmodal curve can be noted , where a gradual decrease in na value with increasing strain rate followed by an increase in the high strain rate range is seen . 
In the following analysis , the presence of threshold stress is assumed to be responsible for the display of curvature at low and intermediate strain rates in Fig . 3 . 
If a threshold stress , σ o , below which deformation does not occur exists , the deformation of a material is driven by an effective stress , σ - σ o . 
In this case , the plastic flow behavior is described by the following equation [ 5 ] : where b is the Burgers vector , D the relevant diffusivity , E the Young ’ s modulus , d the grain size , p the grain size exponent , n the true stress exponent and A is the dimensionless material constant . 
The true stress exponent , defined as the one giving the best linearity to the datum points in the plot of ε ^ 1 / n vs . σ on double linear scales , was determined by constructing several plots for different values of n . 
Threshold stress was then estimated from the extrapolation of the line down to zero creep rate . The entire temperature range of the current investigation could be divided into two regions when viewed in terms of the true n value , namely Region I and Region II . 
They cover the temperature range from 450 to 500 ℃ and from 370 to 400 ℃ , respectively . 
Fig . 4a and b represent the relation - ship between ε ^ 1 / n and σ plotted in double linear coordinates for Region I and II , respectively , where the true n value is assumed to be 2 ( grain boundary sliding ) and 5 ( dislocation climb creep ) , respectively . 
In Region I , the data for low and intermediate strain rates below ~ 10 ^ - 2 s ^ - 1 lie well along the straight lines but high strain - rate data notably deviate from the linear relationship . 
This result implies that another deformation mechanism such as dislocation climb creep resides at high strain rates . 
All the data in Region II , on the other hand , show the straight lines for n = 5 . 
The data for 430 ℃ , which is the temperature located on the border between Region I and Region II , could be most successively analyzed when assuming that dislocation climb creep and grain boundary sliding dominates the plastic flow at high , intermediate and low strain rates , respectively . 
Using the threshold stress obtained by the linear intercept extrapolation method , a logarithmic plot of ε vs . the modulus - compensated effective stress , ( σ - σ o ) / E was constructed ( see Fig . 5 ) . 
As anticipated , the data in Region I and II provide a reasonable fit to straight lines with the true stress exponent of n = 2 or n = 5 . 
Note that the data for 430 ℃ exhibit two slopes corresponding to n = 2 and n = 5 at low and high strain rates , respectively . 
The activation energies for the plastic flow in Regions I and II were determined through a semi - logarithm plot of ε vs . 1 / T at given modulus - compensated effective stresses . 
This is shown in Fig . 6 . 
The activation energies for the plastic flow in Regions I and II are 160 and 143 kJ / mole , respectively . 
Both values are close to the activation energy value for self - diffusion in Al ( 142 kJ / mole ) . 
In Fig . 7 , the relation of ε / DL vs . ( σ - σ o ) / E was analyzed , where DL is the lattice self - diffusion coefficient for pure aluminum . The phenomenological relations developed for a number of superplastic metallic alloys [ 6 ] ( mark A ) and superplastic PM aluminum composites [ 7 ] ( mark B ) are indicated as dotted lines . 
The ε / DL vs . ( σ - σ o ) / E relation for a PM 20 vol . % SiCp / 2124 Al composite ( dp 58 μ m , where p and dp denote the particulate and its diameter , respectively ) obtained in similar temperatures as for Region II [ 8 ] is also provided in the same plot ( mark C ) . 
This composite has SiC particulates , whose size and volume fraction are similar to those of Si particles in the Al – 25Si alloy . 
Fig . 7 , where all the datum points for the present alloy are shown to be well superimposed on common lines , indicates that the strength of the Al – 25Si alloy is ( 1 ) higher than that of the conventional superplastic metallic alloys in Region I and ( 2 ) very similar to that of the superplastic PM aluminum composites in Region I and II . 
Based on this observation , one may conclude that the Al – 25Si alloy behaves almost like aluminum composites at elevated temperatures . 
The strain rate – stress relationship for the present alloy has been compared with those for the PM Al – 25Si and PM Al – 15Si alloys [ 2 , 3 ] at 475 ℃ , after compensating for the grain size effect on superplastic flow . 
A stress exponent , p , in Eq . ( 1 ) is assumed to be 2 [ 6 ] . 
The compared result is shown in Fig . 8 . 
A good correlation can be noted . 
The fact that all the data for the Al – Si alloys with different size and volume fraction of Si particles merge quite well into a single curve after the normalization by grain size implies that the strength of superplastic Al – Si alloys is primarily determined by the grain size of the aluminum matrix rather than by the volume fraction and size of Si particles . 
This elimination of the strengthening effect by reinforcement ( Si particles ) is probably due to full relaxation around the Si particles anticipated to occur when the temperature is sufficiently high . 
Surfaces of the tensile samples obtained after the elongation - to - failure tests were examined by SEM microscopy . 
Whisker formation was observed to occur essentially at all the experimental conditions at the local rupture sites opened by cracking ( Fig . 9a ) or on the final fracture surface ( Fig . 9b ) . 
The density and length of the whiskers were different , depending on the temperature and strain rate . 
Fig . 9a also shows that whiskers have formed from the flow lines covering the grain surfaces shown in Fig . 10 . 
Formation of whiskers has been also reported in the PM Al – Si alloys [ 2 , 3 ] and other superplastic aluminum alloys [ 9 , 10 ] . 
Examination of fracture surfaces at a given temperature of 500 ℃ as a function of strain rate indicates that the most extensive whisker formation took place at the strain rate where the largest tensile elongation was obtained ( 5 × 10 ^ - 4 s ^ - 1 ) . 
Formation of band containing wavy flow lines with a spacing of about 0 . 5 ~ 1 μ m was observed on the surface of the tensile sample , which were mostly perpendicular to the tensile axis ( Fig . 10 ) . 
This band formation appears to occur at grain boundaries but does not occur at all the grain boundaries . 
This is demonstrated in Fig . 9b . 
Fibers are seen at grain boundaries surrounding grain groups that are almost free of whiskers . 
The diameter of the grain groups surrounded by fiber bands is between 15 and 20 μ m . 
It is worthwhile to point out that the observed features regarding whisker - formation in the present study agree well with the observations by Cao et al . [ 10 ] on a superplastic 7475 Al alloy . 
The following features are considered to be good evidence supporting the idea that whisker formation is related to liquidation of Al material . 
A number of nodes of different sizes are observed to be along the whiskers as shown in Fig . 11 . 
This morphology is very similar to a liquid drop attached to the whiskers . 
Chemical composition of the whisker in Fig . 11 has been investigated by EDS and the result is summarized in Table 1 . 
The EDS analysis indicates that the whisTable 1 Chemical composition of whiskerskers or flow lines contain much higher silicon and copper atoms than anticipated in the Al matrix . 
This high segregation of solute atoms supports a possibility that localized melting occurred during plastic flow . 
As the solute solubility in Al is higher in liquid than in solid , supersaturation of Cu atoms is possible upon solidification of the locally melted Al matrix . 
One may evaluate the extent of the deformation that whiskers have experienced during the fracture process based on Fig . 9a . 
If an initial whisker length is taken as the width of the grain boundary layer , which is assumed to be similar to the thickness of the flow line in the band structure ( ~ 1 μ m ) , it can be realized that tensile elongation , estimated from the longest fibers shown in the figure , which are 70 ~ 80 μ m in length , is as high as 7000 ~ 8000 % . 
This much of large elongation with relatively uniform elongation along the length of fibers is anticipated when Newtonian viscous flow of a liquid or semi - liquid material is responsible for the deformation . 
The idea for formation of liquid - like materials at the grain boundary area during grain boundary sliding was proposed by Valiev et al . [ 11 ] . 
According to them , grain boundaries absorb dislocations generated during deformation , become saturated and then destabilize due to the coalescence of dislocation cores , leading to liquid state at the grain boundary area . 
An alternative possibility is the liquid phase formation caused by local melting Al matrix as a result of solute segregation at Al grain boundaries or Si – Al matrix interphases . 
This possibility , however , is inconsistent with the current DSC result where the incipient melting temperature was measured to be 563 ℃ . 
It should be pointed out that extensive formation of whiskers was observed at 475 ℃ , which is significantly lower by 88 ℃ . 
From the studies on the high - temperature mechanical properties of a spray - deposited Al – 25Si alloy , the following results were obtained : 
A maximum tensile elongation of ~ 250 % was obtained at 5 × 10 ^ - 4 s ^ - 1 and 500 ℃ . 
The activation energy for plastic flow , which has been revealed after considering the presence of the threshold stress , was found to be close to that for self - diffusion in pure aluminum . 
It was found that the present Al – 25Si alloy almost behaves like aluminum matrix composites with discontinuous particles in both temperature ranges where grain boundary sliding and dislocation climb creep control the plastic flow . 
Extensive whisker formation was observed , especially in the experimental conditions where a large tensile elongation was obtained . 
This formation of whiskers appears to be related to the liquidation of grain boundary material during grain boundary sliding . 
Title : Microstructure and phase formation in spray - deposited Al – 18 % Si – 5 % Fe – 1 . 5 % Cu alloy 
The Al alloy containing 18 % Si , 5F % e and 1 . 5 % Cu was spray - deposited using convergent – divergent nozzle geometry . 
Nitrogen gas was used as atomization medium . 
Microstructure and phase constitution of over - sprayed powders as well as spray deposit were studied . 
Spray - deposited alloy revealed 3 - to 10 - μ m size particulates of primary Si phase co - existing with rectangular shape intermetallic β - Al5SiFe and δ - Al4Si2Fe phases . 
This is in contrast to as cast alloy that exhibit 90 - to 150 - μ m size particulates of primary Si phase and 120 - to 500 - μ m size rods of Al – Fe – Si base intermetallic phases . 
X - ray diffraction results depicted presence of only δ - Al4Si2Fe phase in over - sprayed powders , whereas , spray - deposited alloy consisted both δ - Al4Si2Fe and β - Al5SiFe phases . 
Energy - dispersive X - ray analysis also corroborates the presence of the above intermetallic phases . 
These results have been discussed in light of the mechanisms involved in the spray deposition process . 
D 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B . V . 
The details of spray forming setup used in the present investigation has been described elsewhere [ 7 ] . 
In brief , this consisted of a nozzle assembly , an atomization chamber , a deposition substrate and a cyclone separator . 
A convergent – divergent nozzle with an annular flow channel has been used . 
A metallic flow tube runs through the annular channel with a ceramic tube insertion so as to avoid premature freezing of the melt . 
The alloy is melted in a resistance heating furnace to a temperature of 950 ° C and allowed to flow through the flow tube in the atomization zone of the nozzle . 
The interaction of the melt with the high velocity N2 gas jet gives rise to a spray of micron - sized droplets that is collected over a cast iron substrate , at a deposition distance of 30 cm . 
The preforms and over - sprayed powder particles thus generated were sectioned and samples were prepared for microstructural examination using standard metallographic technique . 
Phase constitution and composition of different phases have been studied by X - ray diffraction analysis and energy dispersive X - ray analysis . 
The over - sprayed powder particles show ( Fig . 3 - to 9 - μ m size particulates of faceted primary Si phase co - existing with long needles of intermetallic phases having size of 20 – 45 μ m . 
Some of the Si particulates showed rosette - like morphology also ( Fig . 2 ) . 
The microstructure of spray - deposited alloy shows drastic refinement , compared to as cast alloy , with 3 - to 10 μ m size primary Si phase and refined plates of intermetallic phases in bright contrast as depicted in backscattered micrograph ( Fig . 3 ) . 
The aspect ratio of latter is much smaller compared to that observed in over - sprayed powder particles . 
These features are in contrast to the as cast microstructure that consists of large cuboids of primary Si phase with size of 90 – 150 μ m and long bright rods of intermetallic phases with sizes 170 – 600 μ m ( Fig . 4 ) . 
It is interesting to note that the intermetallic phases are not needlelike but transformed to rectangular shape . 
The X - ray diffractograms of the powder as well as the deposit are shownin Fig . 5 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . 
A characteristic CoKa radiation was used for taking diffraction patterns . Powder particles revealed the presence of Al , Si and δ - Al4Si2Fe phases whereas spray - deposited alloy showed Al , Si , δ - Al4Si2Fe , β - Al5SiFe and Al3Fe phases . 
The energy spectrum for different phases in spray - deposited alloy is shown in Fig . 6 ( a ) – ( c ) . 
The matrix showed Al as major phase . 
Whereas , the particulates in grey contrast depicts presence of Si as major element . 
The bright plates in as spraydeposited alloy , shown in Fig . 3 , consists of Al , Si and Fe . 
These plates have revealed a composition of Al4 . 92SiFe1 . 3 that is close to Al5SiFe . 
It was difficult to distinguish between δ - Al4Si2Fe and β - Al5SiFe phases due to their identical morphologies . 
The above microstructural features could be understood in light of the mechanisms involved during spray deposition . 
A wide size range of droplets created during spray atomization is propelled to the substrate under the effect of high velocity gas jet . 
Droplets lose their heat to the atomization gas by convective heat transfer . 
These droplets therefore experience a cooling rate in rapid solidification regime c 10 ^ 3 – 10 ^ 5 ° C s - ^ 1 [ 4 , 8 ] . 
The refined microstructure of primary Si phase and reduced size of intermetallic phases in the oversprayed powder particles , compared to as cast microstructure , is indicative of non - equilibrium solidification of these droplets . 
A comparison of the microstructures of over - sprayed powder and spray deposit shows that Si size is nearly equal . 
However , the primary Si size in spray deposit had been observed to increase with decrease in deposition distance , i . e . increase in incoming enthalpy of the spray . 
The formation of non - equilibrium δ - Al4Si2Fe phase in the powder particles which comes prior to β - Al5SiFe in the solidification sequence of Al – Si – Fe alloys indicates that the droplets undergo extensive undercooling also , prior to solidification . 
In the initial stages of spray deposition , a high cooling rate is encountered at the substrate surface . 
However , with increase in the deposit thickness , a liquid pool is developed on the growing surface of the preform as the heat flow through the deposit to the substrate is reduced . 
As a result , temperature of the pool also increases . 
During deposition of high velocity droplets , a high momentum transfer from the droplets to the top surface of the deposit causes a turbulent fluid flow condition in the liquid pool . 
This leads to fragmentation of already existing or developing phases . 
As a result , the development of long rods of intermetallic phases is hampered in spray deposition [ 4 , 8 , 9 ] . 
Sharp edges of the intermetallic phases indicate their break - up after solidification . 
A comparison of the morphology of intermetallic phases in over - sprayed powder and spray deposit show that these phases are much refined compared to primary Si phase . 
This has been attributed basically to the large aspect ratio of intermetallics phase , which adds to easy fragmentation under the effect of turbulent fluid flow condition . 
It is interesting to note that powder exhibited only non - equilibrium tetragonal yAl4Si2Fe phase , whereas spray - deposited alloy consisted of both δ - Al4Si2Fe and β - Al5SiFe . 
Existence of only δ - phase has also been reported by Kim et al . 
[ 10 ] . The non - equilibrium solidification of droplets leads to formation of δ - Al4Si2Fe phase . 
Therefore , the solid phases in the spray will have δ - Al4Si2Fe phase . 
A relatively higher temperature and lower cooling rate of the liquid pool during deposition lead to transformation of δ - Al4Si2Fe to β - Al5SiFe phase . 
As the time of high temperature exposure is short during deposition , transformation of δ - Al4Si2Fe to β - Al5SiFe will not be completed . 
Therefore , both the phases are observed in the spray - deposited alloy . 
It has been reported by Choi et al . 
[ 11 ] that δ - Al4Si2Fe transforms to β - Al5SiFe during isothermal heat treatment . 
Spray atomization and deposition processing of Al – 18 % Si – 5 % Fe – 1 . 5 % Cu alloy gives rise to an order of magnitude refinement and modification in the microstructure compared to as cast alloys . 
Development of long rods of intermetallic phases is hampered during spray deposition . 
High cooling rate experienced by atomized droplets gives rise to nonequilibrium δ - Al4Si2Fe phase . 
Relatively lower cooling rate and high temperature during deposit solidification result in the formation of β - Al5SiFe phase . As a result , spray deposit exhibits both β and δ phases . 
EDAX corroborates the composition of the intermetallic phase as β - Al5SiFe . 
Title : TiC particulate - reinforced Al – 20Si – 5Fe composite fabricated by melt in situ reaction spray forming 
A novel technique in which TiC particulates are fabricated by an in situ reaction in molten aluminum is introduced for producing TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe composite . 
In order to reveal the characteristics of the technique , in this paper the formation mechanism of TiC particulates obtained by this method is studied . 
Both theoretical and experimental results have shown that the TiC particulates are formed by a diffusion mechanism when the molar fraction of aluminum in the preform is greater than 20 . 02 % . 
Contrarily , the TiC particulates are formed by a solutionprecipitation mechanism when the fraction is less than 20 . 02 % . 
An unwanted needle - like phase is always present in the spray - formed alloys . Experimental results have shown that the amount of the brittle phase decreases in spray - formed Al – 20Si – 5Fe preforms with increase in the TiC content , and that the brittle phase can be eliminated completely by adding more than 3 wt . % TiC particulates to the alloy . 
Moreover , another major problem of coarsened silicon particulates , often encountered in hyper - eutectic Al – Si alloy has also been solved by using the technique . 
Elemental Ti ( 360 mesh , 98 % ) , graphite ( 200 mesh , 99 % ) and Al ( 200 mesh , 98 % ) were mixed by dry milling with steel balls for 2 h according to ( 1 - X ) TiC + XAl ( X = 5 , 35 wt . % ) at a C – Ti molar ratio of 1 : 1 . 
Then , each powder mixture was pressed mechanically into a cylindrical preform of 20 mm diameter and 25 mm height . 
The preforms were inserted into molten aluminum alloy held at 900 ° C . 
When all of the reactions were completed ( the end point of the reaction can be determined by observing the evidence of a dazzling light originated from the reacted preform ) , the composites were prepared by spray forming . The melt was atomized using nitrogen gas at 0 . 8 MPa pressure . 
An atomizer – substrate distance of 390 mm , and a delivery tube diameter of 3 . 1 mm were used . 
Some preforms were taken out immediately after all of the reactions were completed in order to study the formation mechanism of the TiC particulates . 
The morphologies of the TiC particulates in the reacted preforms and in the TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe composites were observed using a Cambridge S360 scanning electron microscopy . 
The composite specimens were etched in a solution of mixed acids ( 2ccHF + 3ccHCl + 5ccHNO4 + 250ccH2O ) . 
The needle - like phase was examined using H800 transmission electron microscopy at 200 kV . 
The morphologies of TiC particulates in the reacted preforms with 5 . 0 wt . % Al and 35 wt . % Al , are shown in Fig . 1 . The TiC particulates in these preforms are generally spherical , but the size of most particulates in the preform with 5 . 0 wt . % Al is larger . 
Strictly speaking , the process in which TiC particulates are produced in molten aluminum alloy is a non - equilibrium process . 
However , it is difficult to study thermal diffusivity out of the preforms . 
Considering that there is not enough time to dissipate the heat generated when TiC is produced in molten aluminum alloy , the reaction Ti + C → TiC is complete , thus the Ti – C – Al system can be regarded approximately as an adiabatic system . 
The thermodynamic data of TiC and Al for the present calculations are listed in Table 1 [ 7 , 8 ] . 
For Al = 5 : 0 wt . % , we have γ ≈ 62 : 34 % from Eqs . ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . 
The calculated results shows that about 62 vol . % of the TiC produced in the preform is in the liquid state . 
In this case , the molten TiC will precipitate from the liquid state during the cooling process in quick succession and grow to be larger TiC particulates . The calculated result is confirmed by Fig . 1 ( a ) where most of TiC particulates exhibit a larger shape . 
The effect of the addition of aluminum as a diluent on the theoretical adiabatic temperature ( Tad ) and on the fraction of molten TiC is demonstrated in Fig . 2 . 
As can be seen from this figure , the fraction of molten TiC decreases with increase in the aluminum content in the preforms . 
When the aluminum content reaches and exceeds a critical value , no molten TiC can be formed in the reacted preform . 
For γ = 0 in Eq . ( 2 ) , the critical aluminum content can be achieved , i . e . x ≈ 20 : 02 % , i . e . the TiC particulates produced in the preforms could only be formed by a diffusion mechanism when the fraction of aluminum is greater than 20 . 02 % . 
Contrarily , there would certainly be some TiC particulates formed by a solution - precipitation mechanism in a higher temperature zone . 
In this work , 5 . 0 and 35 wt . % Al in the preform are selected . 
From Fig . 1 , one can easily find that most of the larger TiC particulates exist in the 5 . 0 wt . % Al preform , showing that these TiC particulates are formed by the solution - precipitation mechanism , while all of the TiC particulates in the 35 wt . % Al preform are formed by the diffusion mechanism . 
In this case , their size is finer . 
This shows that the experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical calculations mentioned previously . 
Hypereutectic Al – Si alloys are known to be suitable for use as piston materials . 
Iron is often added to aluminum alloys to enhance their heat resistance . 
However , an unwanted needle - like phase is always present in the spray - formed alloy ( Fig . 3 ) . 
TEM analysis of the alloy billet indicated that the needle - like phases are δ ( Al4FeSi2 ) and β ( Al5FeSi ) , depending on the cooling rate and the melt superheat ( Fig . 4 ) . 
The Al4FeSi2 is a metastable phase , while Al5FeSi phase is a stable phase . 
The reason for the formation of the Al5FeSi phase is associated with the thermal conditions of the impinging droplets , because the solidification process during spray forming occurs in two stages : gas atomization ( rapid cooling ) and droplet consolidation ( relatively slow cooling ) . 
In the case of lower melt temperature ( Fig . 4 ( b ) ) , the Al4FeSi2 phase is able to form within droplets to some extent before deposition . 
Upon droplet deposition , an abrupt fall in the solidification rate occurs on the deposit layer . 
At this time , the Al4FeSi2 phase originating from the droplets can be readily transformed into the stable Al5FeSi phase due to slow cooling effect and due to the fact that Al4FeSi2 phase is extremely metastable . 
This is further verified by the fact that a number of the Al4FeSi2 phases contain some over - spray powders . 
It is clear that the needle - like phases are very harmful for material properties because of their fragility , and so are a potential path for crack growth . 
It is very interesting that the amount of the brittle phase decreases with increasing TiC content and that the brittle phase can be eliminated successfully by adding 3 wt . % TiC particulates to the alloy ( Fig . 5 ) . 
The reason why the needle - like phase is precluded entirely in the final product is that the TiC particulates are formed in situ in the aluminum alloy matrix and can play a role in heterogeneous nucleation . 
This is beneficial to the elimination of the needle - like phase . 
Moreover , one can see that another primary problem of coarsened silicon particulates initially encountered in the hypereutectic Al – Si alloy has also been solved by using this technique ( see Figs . 3 and 5 ) . 
Both theoretical and experimental results have shown that diffusion , and solution - precipitation mechanisms occur during the formation process of the TiC particulates produced by this method . 
When the molar fraction of aluminum in the preform exceeds 20 . 02 % , TiC particulates are formed by the diffusion mechanism . In this case , their size is finer . 
Contrarily , there would certainly be some TiC particulates to be formed by the solution - precipitation mechanism when the fraction of aluminum in the preforms is less than 20 . 02 % . 
In this case , their size is larger . The unwanted needle - like phase has been eliminated successfully by the in situ addition of 3 wt . % TiC particulates to the alloy . 
Title : Microstructure , thermo - physical and mechanical properties of spray - deposited Si – 30Al alloy for electronic packaging application 
In this study , Si – 30Al alloy was synthesized by the spray atomization and deposition technique . 
The microstructure and properties of the alloy were studied using optical microscopy , scanning electron microscopy , coefficient of thermal expansion ( CTE ) and thermal conductivity ( TC ) measurements , and 3 - point bending tests . 
It was found that the microstructure of the alloy after hot pressing is composed of a continuous network of globular primary Si and interpenetrating secondary Al - rich phase . 
The property measurements results indicate that the spray - deposited 70Si30Al alloy has advantageous physical and mechanical characteristics , including low coefficient of thermal expansion ( 6 . 8 × 10 − ^ 6 / K ) , high thermal conductivity ( 118 W / mK ) , low density ( 2 . 42 gcm − ^ 3 ) , high ultimate flexural strength ( 180 MPa ) and Brinell hardness ( 261 ) . 
The nominal composition of the alloy was 70 wt . % Si and 30 wt . % Al . 
The spray - deposition experiments were conducted in a SF - 200 type environmental chamber ( manufactured by General Research Institute for Nonferrous Metals , Beijing , China ) . 
During spray - deposition process , the molten metal was atomized by N2 at 1300 ° C , the distance of atomizing deposition was kept constant at 550 mm . 
For the densification , the perform , after being cut into cylindrical billets was hot pressed for 4 h at a temperature of 570 ° C with a pressure of 240 MPa . 
After hot pressing , the materials were cooled in air . 
The microstructures of the alloy were characterized using light optical microscope ( LOM ) and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) . 
Coefficient of thermal expansion ( CTE ) measurements were conducted on Formastor - Digital tester with a heating rate of 5 ° C / min . 
Thermal conductivity measurements were performed on TCT 416 ( NETZSCH Corporation ) at 50 ° C . 
The 3 - point bending tests with 30 mm span were carried out at room temperature on an Instron 5569 universal electron tension testing system . 
Brinell hardness measurements were performed on a HBV - 30 double - purpose tester with a 1 mm ball indenter . 
Fig . 1 shows optical micrographs of as - cast and as - spraydeposited and hot pressed Si – 30Al alloy for comparison . 
It can be seen that the optical microscopy microstructure of as - cast alloy is composed of the large block - like primary Si phases and coarse flake eutectic , in Fig . 1 ( a ) . 
Some microcracks exist in Si phases , especially in coarse ones , and thus result in the crack growth or even new crack initiation under presence of the stress . 
Fig . 1 ( b ) shows the LOM microstructure of as - spraydeposited and hot pressed alloy , which is composed of a continuous network of globular primary Si and interpenetrating secondary Al - rich phase . 
Network of globular primary Si is surrounded by an Al - rich phases . 
The presence of the globular primary Si was attributed to the high cooling rate , associated with the rapid solidification processes . 
Fig . 2 ( a ) represents a scanning electron micrograph of spray - deposited and hot pressed Si – 30Al alloy . 
Elemental map scan traces of Si and Al in the microstructure shown in Fig . 2 ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively . 
It can be seen that spray - deposited alloy exhibited no Al – Si eutectic in inter - Si regions , and instead these regions consisted of a single Al - rich phase . 
The formation of the globular primary Si phase in the spray - deposited Si – 30Al alloy resulted mainly from the relativity high cooling rates during spraydeposition , which has the intrinsic ability to alter the morphological stability of the Si phase . 
Furthermore , impact deformation and fracture experienced by the partially solidified droplets during spray - deposition may also effectively break the Si phase that formed prior to the deposition stage . 
The presence of such Si phase lead to the increase of the number density of nuclei in the top layer of the spraydeposited material , and effectively inhibited the formation of eutectic Al – Si during deposition . 
Table 1 summarizes some key property data for spraydeposited Si – 30Al alloy and other electronic packaging materials . 
From the applications of electronic packaging materials , it is found that the Kovar and Invar have been the preferred packaging materials because of its welding capacity and its CTE that is compatible with those of semiconductors . 
However , these materials suffer from poor thermal conductivity and high density . 
Cu and Al are often used as baseplates of power modules for their good thermal conductivities , but their CTEs are much higher than desired for attachment of substrates . 
Alumina is also used quite often in electronic packaging applications , although it has the advantages of low density and CTE , its thermal conductivity is rather low . 
Al - 68 % SiC composite combines the benefits of compatible and tailorable CTE , high thermal conductivity and low density , it is a pity that the composite with high SiC content is not easily machinable . 
Beryllia composites , with perfect thermophysical properties , low density and high modulus , are restricted by their toxicity . 
By contrast , The density of spray - deposited 70Si30Al alloy achieved in this study is only one - third that of Kovar , Invar and Cu , and lower than Al – 68 % SiC , BeO and Al , but its TC is nine times that of Kovar or Invar and three times that of alumina . 
From Table 1 , it can be seen that the values of the Brinell hardness and Flexural strength were 261 and 180 MPa , respectively . 
It is beneficial for the packaging materials to have a reasonable stiffness to provide adequate mechanical support for mechanically sensitive components and substrates . 
Obviously , spray - deposited 70Si30Al alloy exhibits lower density , CTE and higher TC , will have a good potential in electron packaging applications . 
Based on the results of this study on 70Si30Al alloy fabricated using spray - deposition technique , the following conclusions can be drawn : The microstructure of spray - deposited 70Si30Al alloy after hot pressing is composed of a continuous network of globular primary Si and interpenetrating secondary Al - rich phase . The thermo - physical characteristics of spray - deposited 70Si30Al alloy combine low coefficient of thermal expansion , high thermal conductivity and low density . 
Additionally , the alloy has a reasonable stiffness and adequate flexural strength . 
This makes them ideal candidate materials for electronic packaging and thermal management . 
Title : Superplastic deformation behavior of spray - deposited hyper - eutectic Al – 25Si alloy 
The mechanical properties of an Al – 25Si alloy fabricated through the spray forming route were studied in a wide range of temperatures covering from 370 to 500 ℃ and the results were compared with those for the powder - metallurgy processed Al – Si alloys studied by other investigators . 
Superplasticity was observed at high - temperatures around 500 ℃ at 5 × 10 ^ - 4 s ^ - 1 . 
The entire temperature range could be divided into two regions where grain boundary sliding and dislocation climb creep dictates plastic flow , respectively . 
The activation energies for effective plastic flow were measured in these two regions and found to be close to that for self - diffusion in pure aluminum . 
It was found that the present Al – 25Si alloy almost behaves like superplastic aluminum matrix at elevated temperatures . 
Extensive whisker formation was observed and liquidation of grain boundary material during grain boundary sliding appears to be responsible for it . 
The material used in the current investigation was prepared via spray forming . 
The chemical composition is given as Al – 25Si – 3 . 7Cu - 1Mg – 0 . 42Fe in weight percent ( hereafter , denoted as ‘ Al – 25Si alloy ’ ) . 
The detailed procedures regarding the preparation of the present alloy are discussed elsewhere [ 4 ] . 
An as - received spray - deposited billet was extruded at 450 ℃ ( ratio of 50 : 1 ) at a temperature of 430 ℃ . 
Tensile test samples with a gage length of 5 mm were machined from the extruded bar with the tensile axis parallel to the extrusion direction . 
The strain - rate change ( SRC ) test was conducted in the temperature range from 370 to 500 ℃ by increasing the crosshead speed . 
Prestrain of 10 % was given at the cross - head speed corresponding to a nominal strain rate of 10 ^ 2 s ^ - 1 and a strain of 3 % was imposed subsequently at each interval of cross - head speed . 
Elongation - to - failure tests were conducted under constant cross - head speed condition . 
The microstructural characterization before and after the elongation - to - failure tests was examined by using optics and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) . 
The compositions of whiskers and flow lines developed on grain surfaces and the fractured surface of specimens were determined by energy - dispersive X - ray spectrometry ( EDS ) . 
Differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) was conducted at a heating rate of 10 ℃ / min to determine the initial melting temperature of the present alloy . 
It was found to be 563 ℃ . 
A typical photograph showing a microstructural morphology of the present alloy obtained after extrusion is shown in Fig . 1 . 
The aluminum - matrix grains ( white color ) are equiaxed and fine , and have a fairly wide size distribution ranging from 2 to 15 μ m . 
The linear intercept grain size was determined as 8 μ m . 
Silicon particles ( gray color ) whose size is also in a wide range between 2 and 10 μ m are observed to be uniformly distributed over the Al matrix . 
Fig . 2 shows the elongation - to - failure test results as a function of strain rate at three temperatures in a range between 475 and 515 ℃ . 
A maximum tensile elongation of ~ 250 % was obtained at 5 × 10 ^ - 4 s ^ - 1 and at 500 ℃ . 
This value of tensile elongation is larger than ~ 150 % recorded in the PM Al – 25Si alloy [ 1 , 2 ] , but the strain rate associated with the maximum tensile elongation is lower than that for the PM Al – 25Si alloy ( 10 ^ - 2 s ^ - 1 ) . 
This decrease in the optimum strain rate should be attributed to the larger grain size of the present alloy , compared to that of the PM Al – 25Si alloy ( ~ 2 μ m ) . 
The relationship between strain rate and stress in a log – log plot at various temperatures between 370 and 500 ℃ is shown in Fig . 3 . 
At this temperature interval , the slope of the curve , representing the value of apparent stress exponent , na , varies with strain rate . 
A typical sigmodal curve can be noted , where a gradual decrease in na value with increasing strain rate followed by an increase in the high strain rate range is seen . 
In the following analysis , the presence of threshold stress is assumed to be responsible for the display of curvature at low and intermediate strain rates in Fig . 3 . 
If a threshold stress , σ o , below which deformation does not occur exists , the deformation of a material is driven by an effective stress , σ - σ o . 
In this case , the plastic flow behavior is described by the following equation [ 5 ] : where b is the Burgers vector , D the relevant diffusivity , E the Young ’ s modulus , d the grain size , p the grain size exponent , n the true stress exponent and A is the dimensionless material constant . 
The true stress exponent , defined as the one giving the best linearity to the datum points in the plot of ε ^ 1 / n vs . σ on double linear scales , was determined by constructing several plots for different values of n . 
Threshold stress was then estimated from the extrapolation of the line down to zero creep rate . The entire temperature range of the current investigation could be divided into two regions when viewed in terms of the true n value , namely Region I and Region II . 
They cover the temperature range from 450 to 500 ℃ and from 370 to 400 ℃ , respectively . 
Fig . 4a and b represent the relation - ship between ε ^ 1 / n and σ plotted in double linear coordinates for Region I and II , respectively , where the true n value is assumed to be 2 ( grain boundary sliding ) and 5 ( dislocation climb creep ) , respectively . 
In Region I , the data for low and intermediate strain rates below ~ 10 ^ - 2 s ^ - 1 lie well along the straight lines but high strain - rate data notably deviate from the linear relationship . 
This result implies that another deformation mechanism such as dislocation climb creep resides at high strain rates . 
All the data in Region II , on the other hand , show the straight lines for n = 5 . 
The data for 430 ℃ , which is the temperature located on the border between Region I and Region II , could be most successively analyzed when assuming that dislocation climb creep and grain boundary sliding dominates the plastic flow at high , intermediate and low strain rates , respectively . 
Using the threshold stress obtained by the linear intercept extrapolation method , a logarithmic plot of ε vs . the modulus - compensated effective stress , ( σ - σ o ) / E was constructed ( see Fig . 5 ) . 
As anticipated , the data in Region I and II provide a reasonable fit to straight lines with the true stress exponent of n = 2 or n = 5 . 
Note that the data for 430 ℃ exhibit two slopes corresponding to n = 2 and n = 5 at low and high strain rates , respectively . 
The activation energies for the plastic flow in Regions I and II were determined through a semi - logarithm plot of ε vs . 1 / T at given modulus - compensated effective stresses . 
This is shown in Fig . 6 . 
The activation energies for the plastic flow in Regions I and II are 160 and 143 kJ / mole , respectively . 
Both values are close to the activation energy value for self - diffusion in Al ( 142 kJ / mole ) . 
In Fig . 7 , the relation of ε / DL vs . ( σ - σ o ) / E was analyzed , where DL is the lattice self - diffusion coefficient for pure aluminum . The phenomenological relations developed for a number of superplastic metallic alloys [ 6 ] ( mark A ) and superplastic PM aluminum composites [ 7 ] ( mark B ) are indicated as dotted lines . 
The ε / DL vs . ( σ - σ o ) / E relation for a PM 20 vol . % SiCp / 2124 Al composite ( dp 58 μ m , where p and dp denote the particulate and its diameter , respectively ) obtained in similar temperatures as for Region II [ 8 ] is also provided in the same plot ( mark C ) . 
This composite has SiC particulates , whose size and volume fraction are similar to those of Si particles in the Al – 25Si alloy . 
Fig . 7 , where all the datum points for the present alloy are shown to be well superimposed on common lines , indicates that the strength of the Al – 25Si alloy is ( 1 ) higher than that of the conventional superplastic metallic alloys in Region I and ( 2 ) very similar to that of the superplastic PM aluminum composites in Region I and II . 
Based on this observation , one may conclude that the Al – 25Si alloy behaves almost like aluminum composites at elevated temperatures . 
The strain rate – stress relationship for the present alloy has been compared with those for the PM Al – 25Si and PM Al – 15Si alloys [ 2 , 3 ] at 475 ℃ , after compensating for the grain size effect on superplastic flow . 
A stress exponent , p , in Eq . ( 1 ) is assumed to be 2 [ 6 ] . 
The compared result is shown in Fig . 8 . 
A good correlation can be noted . 
The fact that all the data for the Al – Si alloys with different size and volume fraction of Si particles merge quite well into a single curve after the normalization by grain size implies that the strength of superplastic Al – Si alloys is primarily determined by the grain size of the aluminum matrix rather than by the volume fraction and size of Si particles . 
This elimination of the strengthening effect by reinforcement ( Si particles ) is probably due to full relaxation around the Si particles anticipated to occur when the temperature is sufficiently high . 
Surfaces of the tensile samples obtained after the elongation - to - failure tests were examined by SEM microscopy . 
Whisker formation was observed to occur essentially at all the experimental conditions at the local rupture sites opened by cracking ( Fig . 9a ) or on the final fracture surface ( Fig . 9b ) . 
The density and length of the whiskers were different , depending on the temperature and strain rate . 
Fig . 9a also shows that whiskers have formed from the flow lines covering the grain surfaces shown in Fig . 10 . 
Formation of whiskers has been also reported in the PM Al – Si alloys [ 2 , 3 ] and other superplastic aluminum alloys [ 9 , 10 ] . 
Examination of fracture surfaces at a given temperature of 500 ℃ as a function of strain rate indicates that the most extensive whisker formation took place at the strain rate where the largest tensile elongation was obtained ( 5 × 10 ^ - 4 s ^ - 1 ) . 
Formation of band containing wavy flow lines with a spacing of about 0 . 5 ~ 1 μ m was observed on the surface of the tensile sample , which were mostly perpendicular to the tensile axis ( Fig . 10 ) . 
This band formation appears to occur at grain boundaries but does not occur at all the grain boundaries . 
This is demonstrated in Fig . 9b . 
Fibers are seen at grain boundaries surrounding grain groups that are almost free of whiskers . 
The diameter of the grain groups surrounded by fiber bands is between 15 and 20 μ m . 
It is worthwhile to point out that the observed features regarding whisker - formation in the present study agree well with the observations by Cao et al . [ 10 ] on a superplastic 7475 Al alloy . 
The following features are considered to be good evidence supporting the idea that whisker formation is related to liquidation of Al material . 
A number of nodes of different sizes are observed to be along the whiskers as shown in Fig . 11 . 
This morphology is very similar to a liquid drop attached to the whiskers . 
Chemical composition of the whisker in Fig . 11 has been investigated by EDS and the result is summarized in Table 1 . 
The EDS analysis indicates that the whisTable 1 Chemical composition of whiskerskers or flow lines contain much higher silicon and copper atoms than anticipated in the Al matrix . 
This high segregation of solute atoms supports a possibility that localized melting occurred during plastic flow . 
As the solute solubility in Al is higher in liquid than in solid , supersaturation of Cu atoms is possible upon solidification of the locally melted Al matrix . 
One may evaluate the extent of the deformation that whiskers have experienced during the fracture process based on Fig . 9a . 
If an initial whisker length is taken as the width of the grain boundary layer , which is assumed to be similar to the thickness of the flow line in the band structure ( ~ 1 μ m ) , it can be realized that tensile elongation , estimated from the longest fibers shown in the figure , which are 70 ~ 80 μ m in length , is as high as 7000 ~ 8000 % . 
This much of large elongation with relatively uniform elongation along the length of fibers is anticipated when Newtonian viscous flow of a liquid or semi - liquid material is responsible for the deformation . 
The idea for formation of liquid - like materials at the grain boundary area during grain boundary sliding was proposed by Valiev et al . [ 11 ] . 
According to them , grain boundaries absorb dislocations generated during deformation , become saturated and then destabilize due to the coalescence of dislocation cores , leading to liquid state at the grain boundary area . 
An alternative possibility is the liquid phase formation caused by local melting Al matrix as a result of solute segregation at Al grain boundaries or Si – Al matrix interphases . 
This possibility , however , is inconsistent with the current DSC result where the incipient melting temperature was measured to be 563 ℃ . 
It should be pointed out that extensive formation of whiskers was observed at 475 ℃ , which is significantly lower by 88 ℃ . 
From the studies on the high - temperature mechanical properties of a spray - deposited Al – 25Si alloy , the following results were obtained : 
A maximum tensile elongation of ~ 250 % was obtained at 5 × 10 ^ - 4 s ^ - 1 and 500 ℃ . 
The activation energy for plastic flow , which has been revealed after considering the presence of the threshold stress , was found to be close to that for self - diffusion in pure aluminum . 
It was found that the present Al – 25Si alloy almost behaves like aluminum matrix composites with discontinuous particles in both temperature ranges where grain boundary sliding and dislocation climb creep control the plastic flow . 
Extensive whisker formation was observed , especially in the experimental conditions where a large tensile elongation was obtained . 
This formation of whiskers appears to be related to the liquidation of grain boundary material during grain boundary sliding . 
Title : Microstructures and mechanical properties of spray - formed and squeeze - cast Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg alloys in solutionized and aged conditions 
The microstructures and mechanical properties of spray - formed and squeeze - cast Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg alloys in solutionized and aged conditions were compared . 
DSC analysis was used to study the degree of supersaturation between the spray - formed and squeeze - cast alloys , and the tensile properties of extruded spray - formed alloy in various heat treatment conditions were investigated . 
The as - spray - formed alloy exhibits more uniform and finer microstructures than the as - squeeze - cast alloy . 
The Al2Cu was the main phase involved in the solutionizing and aging heat treatment . 
DSC analysis showed the spray - formed alloy had higher degree of supersaturation than the squeeze - cast alloy . 
For the same heat treatment condition , the matrix microhardness of spray - formed alloy is higher than that of squeeze - cast alloy . 
The aging hardening curves reveal two peaks and the time to peaks for the spray - formed alloy is shorter than that for the squeeze - cast alloy . 
The peak - aged spray - formed alloy exhibits an ultimate strength of 366 . 0 MPa , a yield strength of 235 . 3 MPa and an elongation of about 3 . 4 % . 
Squeeze casting and spray forming processes were employed to produce the Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg alloy . 
During the spray forming process , the molten metal was heated to 1123 K , then flowed through the nozzle and atomizer . 
The nitrogen gas was used to atomize the molten metal into droplets and these droplets were deposited on a substrate to form a billet . 
The schematic diagram of spray forming process was shown in Fig . 1 , and the process parameters were listed in Table 1 . 
By using these process parameters , the porosity in the spray - formed billet could be controlled to be about 1 . 1 % . 
For the squeeze casting , the alloy was heated to 1083 K , then cast with the pressure of 700 kg / mm ^ 2 . 
All of the process parameters of squeeze casting were also summarized in Table 1 . 
The sample sizes used in the heat treatment experiments were 15 mm × 15 mm × 15 mm . 
Various solutionizing temperatures and times listed in Table 2 were studied . 
The Vickers microhardness tester with a load of 10 g was employed to measure the microhardness of a - Al matrix after solutionizing . 
Optimum solutionizing temperature and time , for which the maximum hardness was obtained , were determined . 
To study the aging behavior , the samples were solutionized in the optimum solutionizing condition first , then aged at 473 K for various times , as listed in Table 2 . 
After aging treatment , the Vickers microhardness tester was used to measure the microhardness of a - Al , and the Rockwell B scale ( HRB ) hardness tester was used to measure the macrohardness of both the Si particles and a - Al matrix . 
To reveal the microstructures of as - spray - formed and assqueeze - cast Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg alloys , the samples were polished and etched by the Keller ’ s reagent [ 0 . 5HF – 1 . 5HCl – 2 . 5HNO3 – 95 . 5H2O ] and then analyzed by an optical microscope . 
Thermo - Calc software was used to simulate the phases formation in the equilibrium state , and JOELJEM - 3010 TEM and Philips XL - 40 SEM with EDX were employed to analyze the intermetallic compounds and precipitates . 
Furthermore , in order to identify the phase formation during aging treatment , a DSC instrument with a heating rate of 10 K / min was employed to measure the change of heat flux of the solutionized specimens during the precipitation . 
Due to the limited dimensions of the squeeze - cast materials , only the spray - formed Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg alloy could be extruded into bars at 653 K with a reduction ratio of 42 % . 
These extruded bars were heat treated in various conditions then machined into tensile specimens . 
The tensile properties , including the 0 . 2 % offset yield strength , ultimate tensile strength , fracture stress and elongation , were tested by Shimadzu AG - 5000G universal testing machine with initial strain rate of 10 − ^ 3 / s , and the engineering stress – strain curves were recorded . 
Fig . 2 shows the microstructures of as - spray - formed and as - squeeze - cast Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg alloys . 
The microstructure of as - squeeze - cast alloy is composed mainly of primary Si particles and needle - like eutectic Al – Si phase , as shown in Fig . 2 ( b ) . 
The primary Si particles , distributed non - uniformly , in the as - squeeze - cast alloy have sharp edges . 
Fig . 2 ( a ) shows the microstructure of the as - spray - formed alloy , which is composed only of the round Si particles and a - Al matrix . 
The Si particles in the as - spray - formed alloy were distributed uniformly , and the needle - like eutectic phases , which were observed in the as - squeeze - cast alloy , were not found . 
The Si particle size of as - spray - formed alloy is about 2 . 1 μ m , but the primary Si particle size of as - squeeze - cast alloy is over 100 μ m , which is apparently much larger than that of as - sprayformed alloy . 
The difference of microstructures between the as - spray - formed and as - squeeze - cast alloys can be attributed to the high solidification rate occurring in the spray forming process , which was in the range of 10 ^ 2 – 10 ^ 3 K / s . 
As the solidification rate increased , the nucleation rate of Si increased and the growth rate was suppressed . 
Thus , the large amount of fine and uniformly distributed Si particles were formed in the as - sprayformed Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg alloy . 
Because of small segregation of the spray - formed Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg alloy , a - Al grain boundary was difficult to be revealed by the Keller ’ s etching reagent . 
In order to compare the a - Al grain size between the as - sprayformed and as - squeeze - cast alloys , the former was heated to 858 K , equivalent to 85 % liquid fraction , held for 2 . 5 min , then quenched into the water . 
By this method , the a - Al grain boundary was revealed clearly with etching reagent . 
However , grain growth was inevitable as shown by the coarsening of Si particles from 2 . 1 μ m to 4 . 7 μ m . 
Fig . 3 shows the comparison of a - Al grain size between treated spray - formed and as - squeeze - cast alloys . 
The grain size of as - spray - formed alloy , which is about 8 μ m , is smaller than the second dendrite arm spacing of as - squeeze - cast alloy , which is in the range of 10 – 14 μ m . 
Therefore , the grain size of the as - squeezecast alloy should be much larger than that of as - spray - formed alloy . 
Fig . 4 shows the variations of microhardness between sprayformed and squeeze - cast Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg alloys that treated at various solutionizing temperatures and times . 
The microhardness was measured only in the a - Al matrix to study the variations of hardness of a - Al matrix at various solutionizing conditions . 
Fig . 4 shows that the microhardness increases but the time to reach the maximum hardness decreases with increasing the solutionizing temperature . 
As solutionizing temperature increased , the solubility and diffusivity of solute atoms increased , hence , more solute atoms diffused into the matrix quickly , which leaded that the microhardness increased and the time to reach the maximum hardness decreased . 
Table 3 shows the maximum microhardness and the time to reach it for various solutionizing temperatures . 
The maximum microhardness at 788K and 803K are close , but the time to reach the maximum microhardness is shorter for 803K than that for 788K . 
The temperature of 788K and the time of 3h and 2h were selected as the solutionizing temperatures and times for the following aging treatment for the spray - formed and squeeze - cast alloys , respectively . 
Fig . 4 also shows that for the same solutionizing temperature , the microhardness of spray - formed alloy is higher than that of 
squeeze - cast alloy , which may be attributed to the following factors . 
First , the spacing between Si particles in the spray - formed alloy is only slightly lager than the microhardness indentation , as shown in Fig . 5 . 
Therefore , the deformation caused by the microhardness indentation was restricted by the Si particles around the indentation , which increased the microhardness . 
Second , when the specimens quenched from the solutionizing temperature , point defects and line defects formed around the Si particles due to the large thermal stress generated by the significant difference of thermal expansion coefficients between Si and Al . These defects interacted with the dislocations and caused the increase of the microhardness . 
Hence , the microhardness in the sprayformed alloy was higher than that in the squeeze - cast alloy due to the larger amounts of closely adjacent Si particles in the spray - formed alloy . 
Third , the hardness indentation in spray - formed alloy included some grain boundaries in the matrix due to small grain size , which , hence , increased the microhardness . 
Fourth , the degree of supersaturation of solute atoms in the spray - formed alloy was higher than that in the squeeze - cast alloy , which leaded to increase in the microhardness . 
Fig . 6 shows the DSC curves of the spray - formed and squeeze - cast alloys solutionized at 788K for 3h and 2h , respectively . Two exothermic peaks , peaks A and B , and one endothermic peak , peak C , are shown in Fig . 6 . 
Peaks A and B are related to the formation of the precipitates , and peak C the dissolution of the precipitates . 
In the spray - formed alloy , the heat content from peak A is about 1 . 51 J / g , and that from park B is about 2 . 21 J / g . 
In the squeeze - cast alloy , the heat content from peak A is about 1 . 95 J / g , and that from peak B is about 0 . 16 J / g . 
The total heat contents from peaks A and B in the sprayformed alloy is about 3 . 72 J / g , which is much higher than that in the squeeze - cast alloy , which was about 2 . 11 J / g . 
This means that there were more precipitates formed for the spray - formed alloy than for the squeeze - cast alloy during DSC examination . 
Therefore , the solutionized spray - formed alloy had larger amounts of supersaturated solute atoms and , thus , higher degree of supersaturation than the solutionized squeeze - cast alloy , which caused the solutionized spray - formed alloy to have higher microhardness than the solutionized squeeze - cast alloy . 
Fig . 7 shows the variations of microhardness of a - Al matrix aged at 473 K for various times . 
For the same aging temperature , the microhardness of spray - formed alloy is higher than that of the squeeze - cast alloy , which was caused by the same factors discussed in Section 3 . 2 . 1 , including the effects of the spacing between Si particles , amounts of quenched - in defects , the amount of the grain boundaries , and the higher degree of the supersaturation in the solutionized spray - formed alloy forming more precipitates during aging treatment . 
Each of the hardness curves apparently has two peaks , and the times for the spray - formed alloy to reach the peaks are shorter than those for the squeeze - cast alloy . 
Some investigations [ 20 ] reported that the first peak corresponded to the formation of GP zone . 
As the aging time increased , the precipitates transformed gradually from the metastable state to the stable state , and the interfaces between the precipitates and matrix also transformed from being coherent or semicoherent to being incoherent . 
When the interface became incoherent , the hardness decreased by relieving the lattice strain around the precipitates . 
Therefore , the second peak was the occurrence of the largest lattice strain , which the dislocations must be forced through causing the maximum hardness . 
Beyond the second peak , the hardness decreased gradually due to the release of lattice strain and the growth of the precipitates . 
Furthermore , the time to the both peaks for spray - formed alloy was shorter than that for the squeeze - cast alloy . 
This was attributed to the larger amounts of small Si particles in the asspray - formed alloy . 
When the samples were quenched from the solutionizing temperature , point defects and line defects were formed around the Si particles due to the large thermal stress generated by the significant difference of thermal expansion coefficients between Si and Al . 
These defects served as the nucleation sites of precipitates promoting the precipitation [ 19 ] . Because of the larger amounts of Si particles in the spray - formed alloy , the numbers of the nucleation sites for precipitates were larger , so the time to peak hardness was shorter than that in the squeeze - cast alloy . 
Fig . 8 shows the variations of macrohardness , which was measured with HRB including both a - Al and Si phases , at 473K for various times . 
The macrohardness decreases as the aging time increases , and the peak agings are at 2h of aging time , for both spray - formed and squeeze - cast alloys . 
Comparing with the microhardness , the difference in the macrohardness between the spray - formed and squeeze - cast alloys is not much different . This was attributed to the different deformation behaviors occurring in the hardness test between spray - formed and squeeze - cast alloys . 
Fig . 9 shows the microstructures of Si around the bottoms and edges of HRB indentations . 
During the HRB hardness test , the coarse Si particles at the indentation in the squeeze - cast alloy was broken after loading as shown in Fig . 9 ( a ) and ( b ) , which contributed to the increase in hardness . 
However , the fine Si particles in the spray - formed alloy in the indentation were compressed and flowed with the matrix without being broken as shown in Fig . 9 ( c ) and ( d ) , which did not give significant increase in hardness . 
Through this additional contribution , the difference of macrohardness between the spray - formed and squeeze cast alloys become less apparent . 
For the subsequent mechanical testing , the temperature of 473K and the peak aging times of 10h and 14h shown in the microhardness tests were selected as for spray - formed and squeeze - cast alloys , respectively . 
Fig . 10 shows the phase fractions versus temperatures at equilibrium state calculated by the Thermo - Calc software , which predicts that the phases such as Si , Al , Al3Ni , Mg2Si and Al2Cu may appear in the Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg alloy . 
However , the Al2Cu is the only phase that is solutionized completely at the solutionizing temperatures of 788K . 
Fig . 11 shows the Al3Ni compounds in the as - spray - formed and as - squeeze - cast alloy , which are the rod - like shape . 
Fig . 12 shows the TEM image of spray - formed alloy treated at peak aging condition . 
In the ␣ Al grain , Al – Cu and Mg – Si phases are present , and identified by the EDX to be Al2Cu and Mg2Si , the size of which are 28 – 30 nm and 10 – 14 nm , respectively . 
These results show good agreement with those from the calculation of Thermo - Calc software . 
To identify the main phases affecting the heat treatment characteristics , the spray - formed and squeeze - cast alloys solutionized at 788 K for 3h and 2h , respectively , were analyzed by the DSC , as shown in Fig . 6 . 
Starink and Van Mourik [ 21 ] investigated the precipitation behavior of Al - 1 . 3 at . % Cu - 19 . 1 at . % Si , and found that an obvious exothermic peak occurred at 538 K , which represented the simultaneous precipitation of Silicon and θ ' or θ ( Al2Cu ) phases . 
Takeda et al . [ 22 ] studied the precipitation behaviors of Al – Cu alloys with Cu contents from 0 . 56 % to 2 . 18 % by DSC technique . 
For various Cu contents , there were three or four exothermic peaks existing in the DSC curves , which represented the formation of GP zone , θ ' ' , θ ' and θ ( Al2Cu ) phases . 
The peaks of the GP zone and θ ' ' were present in the temperature range of 350 – 500 K , and those of the θ ' and θ occurred in the temperature range of 600 – 700 K . 
In the present DSC study , exothermic peak B at about 525K is close to the results of Starink and Van Mourik [ 21 ] , and the peak A , which is at about 480K , agrees well with Takada ’ s investigation [ 22 ] . 
Therefore , peaks A and B are suggested to be related mainly to the precipitation of Al2Cu phases . 
Moreover , the onset temperature of endothermic peak C is about 655K , which is close to the predicted dissolution temperature ( ∼ 641K ) of Al2Cu in Fig . 10 . 
Hence , the endothermic peak C was due to the dissolution of Al2Cu precipitates . 
According to the above data , the Al2Cu was the main phase involved in the solutionizing and aging heat treatment . 
Fig . 13 shows the engineering stress – strain curve , 0 . 2 % offset yield strength , ultimate tensile strength , fracture strength and elongation of extruded spray - formed alloy varied with different heat treatment conditions . 
Table 4 shows the extruded materials treated at peak aging condition exhibits the maximum ultimate strength , but the lowest elongation . 
The strength of the alloy increasing after the aging treatment was attributed to the effects of precipitates in the matrix . 
During the deformation , the precipitates restricted the movement of dislocation and the dislocation density increased around these precipitates , which increased the flow stress during the deformation . 
The elongation decreasing after the precipitation heat treatment may be related with the mechanism of the growth of microvoids . 
In the spray - formed materials , the precipitates were numerous and uniformly distributed in the matrix , which served as the nucleation sites of voids reducing the resistance of the cavitation of the matrix and also causing the connection of microvoids in a shorter interval of time [ 23 , 24 ] . 
Both of these effects decreased the ductility significantly . 
Fig . 14 shows the tensile fracture surface of extruded sprayformed alloys with no heat treatment and with peak - aged at 473K . 
Numerous dimples of about only 2 – 5 μ m indicate quick connection of the microvoids , which reduced the elongation significantly . 
The microstructure of as - spray - formed Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg is finer and more uniform than that of assqueeze - cast alloy . 
The primary Si particle sizes in the asspray - formed and as - squeeze - cast alloys are about 2 . 1 μ m and over 100 μ m , respectively . 
The a - Al grain size of sprayformed alloy is smaller than 8 μ m , which is smaller than the second dendrite arm spacing of the squeeze - cast alloy about 10 – 14 μ m . The main phase involved in the solutionizing and aging heat treatment is Al2Cu . For both the spray - formed and squeeze - cast alloys , the microhardness increased and the time to peak hardness decreased with increasing solutionizing temperature , which was due to the increase of solubility and diffusivity of solute atoms with temperatures . The spacing between Si particles in the spray - formed alloy was only slightly larger than the microhardness indentation ; hence , the deformation caused by microhardness indentation was restricted by Si particles around the indentation , which increased the microhardness . From the DSC analysis , the total heat contents of exothermic reactions in the solutionized spray - formed alloy were larger than that of solutionized squeeze - cast alloy ; therefore , the solutionized spray - formed alloy had higher degree of supersaturation than the solutionized squeeze - cast alloy . For the same solutionizing temperature , the microhardness of spray - formed alloy was higher than that of squeeze - cast alloy , which was attributed to the effects of small spacing between Si particles , larger amounts of quenched - in defects , smaller grains , and higher degree of supersaturation , of the former alloy . 
For the same aging temperature , the microhardness of sprayformed alloy was also higher than that of squeeze - cast alloy , which was attributed to the effects of small spacing between Si particles , larger amounts of quenched - in defects , smaller grains , and higher degree of supersaturation to form more precipitates , of the former alloy . Two peaks are shown in the aging hardening curves measured by microhardness . 
The time to both peaks for the spray - formed alloy was shorter than that for the squeezecast alloy due to the higher density of the quenched - in defects caused by the larger amounts of small particles in the spray - formed alloy , which promoted the formation of the precipitation . 
The aging hardening curves measured by the macrohardness revealed no obvious difference between the spray - formed and squeeze - cast alloys , which were attributed to the different deformation behaviors occurring during the hardness test . The spray - formed alloy after precipitation treatment exhibited an ultimate strength of 366 . 0 MPa , a 0 . 2 % offset yield strength of 235 . 3 MPa and an elongation of about 3 . 4 % . 
The low value of the elongation was associated with the numerous microvoids of only 2 – 5 μ m generated by the numerous precipitates , which quickly connected with each other , reducing the elongation significantly . 
Title : Microstructures and mechanical properties of spray - formed and squeeze - cast Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg alloys in solutionized and aged conditions 
The microstructures and mechanical properties of spray - formed and squeeze - cast Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg alloys in solutionized and aged conditions were compared . 
DSC analysis was used to study the degree of supersaturation between the spray - formed and squeeze - cast alloys , and the tensile properties of extruded spray - formed alloy in various heat treatment conditions were investigated . 
The as - spray - formed alloy exhibits more uniform and finer microstructures than the as - squeeze - cast alloy . 
The Al2Cu was the main phase involved in the solutionizing and aging heat treatment . 
DSC analysis showed the spray - formed alloy had higher degree of supersaturation than the squeeze - cast alloy . 
For the same heat treatment condition , the matrix microhardness of spray - formed alloy is higher than that of squeeze - cast alloy . 
The aging hardening curves reveal two peaks and the time to peaks for the spray - formed alloy is shorter than that for the squeeze - cast alloy . 
The peak - aged spray - formed alloy exhibits an ultimate strength of 366 . 0 MPa , a yield strength of 235 . 3 MPa and an elongation of about 3 . 4 % . 
Squeeze casting and spray forming processes were employed to produce the Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg alloy . 
During the spray forming process , the molten metal was heated to 1123 K , then flowed through the nozzle and atomizer . 
The nitrogen gas was used to atomize the molten metal into droplets and these droplets were deposited on a substrate to form a billet . 
The schematic diagram of spray forming process was shown in Fig . 1 , and the process parameters were listed in Table 1 . 
By using these process parameters , the porosity in the spray - formed billet could be controlled to be about 1 . 1 % . 
For the squeeze casting , the alloy was heated to 1083 K , then cast with the pressure of 700 kg / mm ^ 2 . 
All of the process parameters of squeeze casting were also summarized in Table 1 . 
The sample sizes used in the heat treatment experiments were 15 mm × 15 mm × 15 mm . 
Various solutionizing temperatures and times listed in Table 2 were studied . 
The Vickers microhardness tester with a load of 10 g was employed to measure the microhardness of a - Al matrix after solutionizing . 
Optimum solutionizing temperature and time , for which the maximum hardness was obtained , were determined . 
To study the aging behavior , the samples were solutionized in the optimum solutionizing condition first , then aged at 473 K for various times , as listed in Table 2 . 
After aging treatment , the Vickers microhardness tester was used to measure the microhardness of a - Al , and the Rockwell B scale ( HRB ) hardness tester was used to measure the macrohardness of both the Si particles and a - Al matrix . 
To reveal the microstructures of as - spray - formed and assqueeze - cast Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg alloys , the samples were polished and etched by the Keller ’ s reagent [ 0 . 5HF – 1 . 5HCl – 2 . 5HNO3 – 95 . 5H2O ] and then analyzed by an optical microscope . 
Thermo - Calc software was used to simulate the phases formation in the equilibrium state , and JOELJEM - 3010 TEM and Philips XL - 40 SEM with EDX were employed to analyze the intermetallic compounds and precipitates . 
Furthermore , in order to identify the phase formation during aging treatment , a DSC instrument with a heating rate of 10 K / min was employed to measure the change of heat flux of the solutionized specimens during the precipitation . 
Due to the limited dimensions of the squeeze - cast materials , only the spray - formed Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg alloy could be extruded into bars at 653 K with a reduction ratio of 42 % . 
These extruded bars were heat treated in various conditions then machined into tensile specimens . 
The tensile properties , including the 0 . 2 % offset yield strength , ultimate tensile strength , fracture stress and elongation , were tested by Shimadzu AG - 5000G universal testing machine with initial strain rate of 10 − ^ 3 / s , and the engineering stress – strain curves were recorded . 
Fig . 2 shows the microstructures of as - spray - formed and as - squeeze - cast Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg alloys . 
The microstructure of as - squeeze - cast alloy is composed mainly of primary Si particles and needle - like eutectic Al – Si phase , as shown in Fig . 2 ( b ) . 
The primary Si particles , distributed non - uniformly , in the as - squeeze - cast alloy have sharp edges . 
Fig . 2 ( a ) shows the microstructure of the as - spray - formed alloy , which is composed only of the round Si particles and a - Al matrix . 
The Si particles in the as - spray - formed alloy were distributed uniformly , and the needle - like eutectic phases , which were observed in the as - squeeze - cast alloy , were not found . 
The Si particle size of as - spray - formed alloy is about 2 . 1 μ m , but the primary Si particle size of as - squeeze - cast alloy is over 100 μ m , which is apparently much larger than that of as - sprayformed alloy . 
The difference of microstructures between the as - spray - formed and as - squeeze - cast alloys can be attributed to the high solidification rate occurring in the spray forming process , which was in the range of 10 ^ 2 – 10 ^ 3 K / s . 
As the solidification rate increased , the nucleation rate of Si increased and the growth rate was suppressed . 
Thus , the large amount of fine and uniformly distributed Si particles were formed in the as - sprayformed Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg alloy . 
Because of small segregation of the spray - formed Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg alloy , a - Al grain boundary was difficult to be revealed by the Keller ’ s etching reagent . 
In order to compare the a - Al grain size between the as - sprayformed and as - squeeze - cast alloys , the former was heated to 858 K , equivalent to 85 % liquid fraction , held for 2 . 5 min , then quenched into the water . 
By this method , the a - Al grain boundary was revealed clearly with etching reagent . 
However , grain growth was inevitable as shown by the coarsening of Si particles from 2 . 1 μ m to 4 . 7 μ m . 
Fig . 3 shows the comparison of a - Al grain size between treated spray - formed and as - squeeze - cast alloys . 
The grain size of as - spray - formed alloy , which is about 8 μ m , is smaller than the second dendrite arm spacing of as - squeeze - cast alloy , which is in the range of 10 – 14 μ m . 
Therefore , the grain size of the as - squeezecast alloy should be much larger than that of as - spray - formed alloy . 
Fig . 4 shows the variations of microhardness between sprayformed and squeeze - cast Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg alloys that treated at various solutionizing temperatures and times . 
The microhardness was measured only in the a - Al matrix to study the variations of hardness of a - Al matrix at various solutionizing conditions . 
Fig . 4 shows that the microhardness increases but the time to reach the maximum hardness decreases with increasing the solutionizing temperature . 
As solutionizing temperature increased , the solubility and diffusivity of solute atoms increased , hence , more solute atoms diffused into the matrix quickly , which leaded that the microhardness increased and the time to reach the maximum hardness decreased . 
Table 3 shows the maximum microhardness and the time to reach it for various solutionizing temperatures . 
The maximum microhardness at 788K and 803K are close , but the time to reach the maximum microhardness is shorter for 803K than that for 788K . 
The temperature of 788K and the time of 3h and 2h were selected as the solutionizing temperatures and times for the following aging treatment for the spray - formed and squeeze - cast alloys , respectively . 
Fig . 4 also shows that for the same solutionizing temperature , the microhardness of spray - formed alloy is higher than that of 
squeeze - cast alloy , which may be attributed to the following factors . 
First , the spacing between Si particles in the spray - formed alloy is only slightly lager than the microhardness indentation , as shown in Fig . 5 . 
Therefore , the deformation caused by the microhardness indentation was restricted by the Si particles around the indentation , which increased the microhardness . 
Second , when the specimens quenched from the solutionizing temperature , point defects and line defects formed around the Si particles due to the large thermal stress generated by the significant difference of thermal expansion coefficients between Si and Al . These defects interacted with the dislocations and caused the increase of the microhardness . 
Hence , the microhardness in the sprayformed alloy was higher than that in the squeeze - cast alloy due to the larger amounts of closely adjacent Si particles in the spray - formed alloy . 
Third , the hardness indentation in spray - formed alloy included some grain boundaries in the matrix due to small grain size , which , hence , increased the microhardness . 
Fourth , the degree of supersaturation of solute atoms in the spray - formed alloy was higher than that in the squeeze - cast alloy , which leaded to increase in the microhardness . 
Fig . 6 shows the DSC curves of the spray - formed and squeeze - cast alloys solutionized at 788K for 3h and 2h , respectively . Two exothermic peaks , peaks A and B , and one endothermic peak , peak C , are shown in Fig . 6 . 
Peaks A and B are related to the formation of the precipitates , and peak C the dissolution of the precipitates . 
In the spray - formed alloy , the heat content from peak A is about 1 . 51 J / g , and that from park B is about 2 . 21 J / g . 
In the squeeze - cast alloy , the heat content from peak A is about 1 . 95 J / g , and that from peak B is about 0 . 16 J / g . 
The total heat contents from peaks A and B in the sprayformed alloy is about 3 . 72 J / g , which is much higher than that in the squeeze - cast alloy , which was about 2 . 11 J / g . 
This means that there were more precipitates formed for the spray - formed alloy than for the squeeze - cast alloy during DSC examination . 
Therefore , the solutionized spray - formed alloy had larger amounts of supersaturated solute atoms and , thus , higher degree of supersaturation than the solutionized squeeze - cast alloy , which caused the solutionized spray - formed alloy to have higher microhardness than the solutionized squeeze - cast alloy . 
Fig . 7 shows the variations of microhardness of a - Al matrix aged at 473 K for various times . 
For the same aging temperature , the microhardness of spray - formed alloy is higher than that of the squeeze - cast alloy , which was caused by the same factors discussed in Section 3 . 2 . 1 , including the effects of the spacing between Si particles , amounts of quenched - in defects , the amount of the grain boundaries , and the higher degree of the supersaturation in the solutionized spray - formed alloy forming more precipitates during aging treatment . 
Each of the hardness curves apparently has two peaks , and the times for the spray - formed alloy to reach the peaks are shorter than those for the squeeze - cast alloy . 
Some investigations [ 20 ] reported that the first peak corresponded to the formation of GP zone . 
As the aging time increased , the precipitates transformed gradually from the metastable state to the stable state , and the interfaces between the precipitates and matrix also transformed from being coherent or semicoherent to being incoherent . 
When the interface became incoherent , the hardness decreased by relieving the lattice strain around the precipitates . 
Therefore , the second peak was the occurrence of the largest lattice strain , which the dislocations must be forced through causing the maximum hardness . 
Beyond the second peak , the hardness decreased gradually due to the release of lattice strain and the growth of the precipitates . 
Furthermore , the time to the both peaks for spray - formed alloy was shorter than that for the squeeze - cast alloy . 
This was attributed to the larger amounts of small Si particles in the asspray - formed alloy . 
When the samples were quenched from the solutionizing temperature , point defects and line defects were formed around the Si particles due to the large thermal stress generated by the significant difference of thermal expansion coefficients between Si and Al . 
These defects served as the nucleation sites of precipitates promoting the precipitation [ 19 ] . Because of the larger amounts of Si particles in the spray - formed alloy , the numbers of the nucleation sites for precipitates were larger , so the time to peak hardness was shorter than that in the squeeze - cast alloy . 
Fig . 8 shows the variations of macrohardness , which was measured with HRB including both a - Al and Si phases , at 473K for various times . 
The macrohardness decreases as the aging time increases , and the peak agings are at 2h of aging time , for both spray - formed and squeeze - cast alloys . 
Comparing with the microhardness , the difference in the macrohardness between the spray - formed and squeeze - cast alloys is not much different . This was attributed to the different deformation behaviors occurring in the hardness test between spray - formed and squeeze - cast alloys . 
Fig . 9 shows the microstructures of Si around the bottoms and edges of HRB indentations . 
During the HRB hardness test , the coarse Si particles at the indentation in the squeeze - cast alloy was broken after loading as shown in Fig . 9 ( a ) and ( b ) , which contributed to the increase in hardness . 
However , the fine Si particles in the spray - formed alloy in the indentation were compressed and flowed with the matrix without being broken as shown in Fig . 9 ( c ) and ( d ) , which did not give significant increase in hardness . 
Through this additional contribution , the difference of macrohardness between the spray - formed and squeeze cast alloys become less apparent . 
For the subsequent mechanical testing , the temperature of 473K and the peak aging times of 10h and 14h shown in the microhardness tests were selected as for spray - formed and squeeze - cast alloys , respectively . 
Fig . 10 shows the phase fractions versus temperatures at equilibrium state calculated by the Thermo - Calc software , which predicts that the phases such as Si , Al , Al3Ni , Mg2Si and Al2Cu may appear in the Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg alloy . 
However , the Al2Cu is the only phase that is solutionized completely at the solutionizing temperatures of 788K . 
Fig . 11 shows the Al3Ni compounds in the as - spray - formed and as - squeeze - cast alloy , which are the rod - like shape .

For various Cu contents , there were three or four exothermic peaks existing in the DSC curves , which represented the formation of GP zone , θ ' ' , θ ' and θ ( Al2Cu ) phases . 
The peaks of the GP zone and θ ' ' were present in the temperature range of 350 – 500 K , and those of the θ ' and θ occurred in the temperature range of 600 – 700 K . 
In the present DSC study , exothermic peak B at about 525K is close to the results of Starink and Van Mourik [ 21 ] , and the peak A , which is at about 480K , agrees well with Takada ’ s investigation [ 22 ] . 
Therefore , peaks A and B are suggested to be related mainly to the precipitation of Al2Cu phases . 
Moreover , the onset temperature of endothermic peak C is about 655K , which is close to the predicted dissolution temperature ( ∼ 641K ) of Al2Cu in Fig . 10 . 
Hence , the endothermic peak C was due to the dissolution of Al2Cu precipitates . 
According to the above data , the Al2Cu was the main phase involved in the solutionizing and aging heat treatment . 
Fig . 13 shows the engineering stress – strain curve , 0 . 2 % offset yield strength , ultimate tensile strength , fracture strength and elongation of extruded spray - formed alloy varied with different heat treatment conditions . 
Table 4 shows the extruded materials treated at peak aging condition exhibits the maximum ultimate strength , but the lowest elongation . 
The strength of the alloy increasing after the aging treatment was attributed to the effects of precipitates in the matrix .

Both of these effects decreased the ductility significantly . 
Fig . 14 shows the tensile fracture surface of extruded sprayformed alloys with no heat treatment and with peak - aged at 473K . 
Numerous dimples of about only 2 – 5 μ m indicate quick connection of the microvoids , which reduced the elongation significantly . 
The microstructure of as - spray - formed Al – 25Si – 0 . 89Cu – 1 . 0Ni – 0 . 84Mg is finer and more uniform than that of assqueeze - cast alloy .

For the same aging temperature , the microhardness of sprayformed alloy was also higher than that of squeeze - cast alloy , which was attributed to the effects of small spacing between Si particles , larger amounts of quenched - in defects , smaller grains , and higher degree of supersaturation to form more precipitates , of the former alloy . Two peaks are shown in the aging hardening curves measured by microhardness .

The spray - formed alloy after precipitation treatment exhibited an ultimate strength of 366 . 0 MPa , a 0 . 2 % offset yield strength of 235 . 3 MPa and an elongation of about 3 . 4 % . 
The low value of the elongation was associated with the numerous microvoids of only 2 – 5 μ m generated by the numerous precipitates , which quickly connected with each other , reducing the elongation significantly . 
Title : Microstructure and phase formation in spray - deposited Al – 18 % Si – 5 % Fe – 1 . 5 % Cu alloy 
The Al alloy containing 18 % Si , 5F % e and 1 . 5 % Cu was spray - deposited using convergent – divergent nozzle geometry . 
Nitrogen gas was used as atomization medium . 
Microstructure and phase constitution of over - sprayed powders as well as spray deposit were studied . 
Spray - deposited alloy revealed 3 - to 10 - μ m size particulates of primary Si phase co - existing with rectangular shape intermetallic β - Al5SiFe and δ - Al4Si2Fe phases . 
This is in contrast to as cast alloy that exhibit 90 - to 150 - μ m size particulates of primary Si phase and 120 - to 500 - μ m size rods of Al – Fe – Si base intermetallic phases . 
X - ray diffraction results depicted presence of only δ - Al4Si2Fe phase in over - sprayed powders , whereas , spray - deposited alloy consisted both δ - Al4Si2Fe and β - Al5SiFe phases . 
Energy - dispersive X - ray analysis also corroborates the presence of the above intermetallic phases . 
These results have been discussed in light of the mechanisms involved in the spray deposition process . 
D 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B . V . 
The details of spray forming setup used in the present investigation has been described elsewhere [ 7 ] . 
In brief , this consisted of a nozzle assembly , an atomization chamber , a deposition substrate and a cyclone separator . 
A convergent – divergent nozzle with an annular flow channel has been used . 
A metallic flow tube runs through the annular channel with a ceramic tube insertion so as to avoid premature freezing of the melt . 
The alloy is melted in a resistance heating furnace to a temperature of 950 ° C and allowed to flow through the flow tube in the atomization zone of the nozzle . 
The interaction of the melt with the high velocity N2 gas jet gives rise to a spray of micron - sized droplets that is collected over a cast iron substrate , at a deposition distance of 30 cm . 
The preforms and over - sprayed powder particles thus generated were sectioned and samples were prepared for microstructural examination using standard metallographic technique . 
Phase constitution and composition of different phases have been studied by X - ray diffraction analysis and energy dispersive X - ray analysis . 
The over - sprayed powder particles show ( Fig . 3 - to 9 - μ m size particulates of faceted primary Si phase co - existing with long needles of intermetallic phases having size of 20 – 45 μ m . 
Some of the Si particulates showed rosette - like morphology also ( Fig . 2 ) . 
The microstructure of spray - deposited alloy shows drastic refinement , compared to as cast alloy , with 3 - to 10 μ m size primary Si phase and refined plates of intermetallic phases in bright contrast as depicted in backscattered micrograph ( Fig . 3 ) . 
The aspect ratio of latter is much smaller compared to that observed in over - sprayed powder particles . 
These features are in contrast to the as cast microstructure that consists of large cuboids of primary Si phase with size of 90 – 150 μ m and long bright rods of intermetallic phases with sizes 170 – 600 μ m ( Fig . 4 ) . 
It is interesting to note that the intermetallic phases are not needlelike but transformed to rectangular shape . 
The X - ray diffractograms of the powder as well as the deposit are shownin Fig . 5 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . 
A characteristic CoKa radiation was used for taking diffraction patterns . Powder particles revealed the presence of Al , Si and δ - Al4Si2Fe phases whereas spray - deposited alloy showed Al , Si , δ - Al4Si2Fe , β - Al5SiFe and Al3Fe phases . 
The energy spectrum for different phases in spray - deposited alloy is shown in Fig . 6 ( a ) – ( c ) . 
The matrix showed Al as major phase . 
Whereas , the particulates in grey contrast depicts presence of Si as major element . 
The bright plates in as spraydeposited alloy , shown in Fig . 3 , consists of Al , Si and Fe . 
These plates have revealed a composition of Al4 . 92SiFe1 . 3 that is close to Al5SiFe . 
It was difficult to distinguish between δ - Al4Si2Fe and β - Al5SiFe phases due to their identical morphologies . 
The above microstructural features could be understood in light of the mechanisms involved during spray deposition . 
A wide size range of droplets created during spray atomization is propelled to the substrate under the effect of high velocity gas jet . 
Droplets lose their heat to the atomization gas by convective heat transfer . 
These droplets therefore experience a cooling rate in rapid solidification regime c 10 ^ 3 – 10 ^ 5 ° C s - ^ 1 [ 4 , 8 ] . 
The refined microstructure of primary Si phase and reduced size of intermetallic phases in the oversprayed powder particles , compared to as cast microstructure , is indicative of non - equilibrium solidification of these droplets . 
A comparison of the microstructures of over - sprayed powder and spray deposit shows that Si size is nearly equal . 
However , the primary Si size in spray deposit had been observed to increase with decrease in deposition distance , i . e . increase in incoming enthalpy of the spray . 
The formation of non - equilibrium δ - Al4Si2Fe phase in the powder particles which comes prior to β - Al5SiFe in the solidification sequence of Al – Si – Fe alloys indicates that the droplets undergo extensive undercooling also , prior to solidification . 
In the initial stages of spray deposition , a high cooling rate is encountered at the substrate surface . 
However , with increase in the deposit thickness , a liquid pool is developed on the growing surface of the preform as the heat flow through the deposit to the substrate is reduced . 
As a result , temperature of the pool also increases . 
During deposition of high velocity droplets , a high momentum transfer from the droplets to the top surface of the deposit causes a turbulent fluid flow condition in the liquid pool . 
This leads to fragmentation of already existing or developing phases . 
As a result , the development of long rods of intermetallic phases is hampered in spray deposition [ 4 , 8 , 9 ] . 
Sharp edges of the intermetallic phases indicate their break - up after solidification . 
A comparison of the morphology of intermetallic phases in over - sprayed powder and spray deposit show that these phases are much refined compared to primary Si phase . 
This has been attributed basically to the large aspect ratio of intermetallics phase , which adds to easy fragmentation under the effect of turbulent fluid flow condition . 
It is interesting to note that powder exhibited only non - equilibrium tetragonal yAl4Si2Fe phase , whereas spray - deposited alloy consisted of both δ - Al4Si2Fe and β - Al5SiFe . 
Existence of only δ - phase has also been reported by Kim et al . 
[ 10 ] . The non - equilibrium solidification of droplets leads to formation of δ - Al4Si2Fe phase . 
Therefore , the solid phases in the spray will have δ - Al4Si2Fe phase . 
A relatively higher temperature and lower cooling rate of the liquid pool during deposition lead to transformation of δ - Al4Si2Fe to β - Al5SiFe phase . 
As the time of high temperature exposure is short during deposition , transformation of δ - Al4Si2Fe to β - Al5SiFe will not be completed . 
Therefore , both the phases are observed in the spray - deposited alloy . 
It has been reported by Choi et al . 
[ 11 ] that δ - Al4Si2Fe transforms to β - Al5SiFe during isothermal heat treatment . 
Spray atomization and deposition processing of Al – 18 % Si – 5 % Fe – 1 . 5 % Cu alloy gives rise to an order of magnitude refinement and modification in the microstructure compared to as cast alloys . 
Development of long rods of intermetallic phases is hampered during spray deposition . 
High cooling rate experienced by atomized droplets gives rise to nonequilibrium δ - Al4Si2Fe phase . 
Relatively lower cooling rate and high temperature during deposit solidification result in the formation of β - Al5SiFe phase . As a result , spray deposit exhibits both β and δ phases . 
EDAX corroborates the composition of the intermetallic phase as β - Al5SiFe . 
Title : Microstructure and thermal expansion behavior of spray - deposited Al – 50Si 
The evolution of microstructure and coefficient of thermal expansion ( CTE ) of the Al – 50Si ( wt . % ) alloy manufactured by spray deposition followed by hot isostatic pressing ( HIP ) are systematically investigated . 
The results indicate that the microstructure of the deposited alloy is composed of primary Si with average size of 12 . 5 ± 0 . 1 l m and a - Al . 
The CTE of the deposited alloy is higher than the corresponding alloy produced by casting due to the high solid solubility of Al in Si . 
After HIP , the CTE is lower than the parent as - deposited alloy owing to the high solid solubility of Si in Al . 
The residual thermal stress results in a higher CTE during the second heating as a result of the CTE mismatch between the Al matrix and the primary Si particles . 
Furthermore , the measured CTE value is in good agreement with the Turner model after complete densification by HIP at 843 K . 
An alloy with nominal composition Al – 50Si ( wt . % was atomized by nitrogen gas at 1573 K and spray deposited on a cylindrical aluminum substrate . 
The distance between the atomizing nozzle and the substrate was kept constant at 500 mm during the deposited process . 
The atomization pressure was set at 1 . 5 MPa . 
After spray - deposition , the samples were hot isostatically pressed ( HIP ) for 3 h under Ar atmosphere at the temperatures 793 K and 843 K using a pressure of 120 MPa . 
For comparison , an Al – 50Si ingot was produced by conventional solidification using a 65 kW medium frequency induction furnace . 
Before pouring , the melt was degassed with high purity argon for 30 min at about 1573 ± 30 K using a rotary degasser . 
The permanent mold was preheated to 523 K before casting . 
The surface of the melt was skimmed and then the melt was poured into the copper mold , and finally quenched to room temperature . 
The microstructure of the alloy was investigated by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) using a Gemini 1530 microscope equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy ( EDS ) detector . 
The phases were characterized using a Rigaku D / max - RB X - ray diffractometer ( XRD ) with monochromatic Co K a radiation . 
Dilatometry measurements were carried out under argon atmosphere from room temperature to 773 K ( heating rate 5 K / min ) using a thermo - mechanical analysis equipment ( NETZSCH DIL 402C ) in accordance with the ASTM : E473 . 
The thermal expansion of the specimens during heating was measured using a linear position transducer in two consecutive cycles . 
The samples were first heated from 298 to 773 K , then cooled down and stabilized at 298 K , re - heated to 773 K , and finally cooled down to 298 K at a rate of 5 K / min . 
The bulk density of the alloys was measured using the Archimedes principle . 
Image analysis was used to calculate the mean size of the primary Si phase . 
In order to ensure reproducibility of the results , at least ten micrographs were used for the calculation . 
Fig . 1 shows the typical microstructures of the Al – 50Si alloy prepared by casting and spray deposition techniques . 
As illustrated in Fig . 1 ( a ) , the primary Si displays coarse platelet morphology with an average size of 221 . 4 ± 2 . 1 l m in the cast alloy . 
The eutectic Si exhibits plate - like and needle - like shapes , as shown in Fig . 1 ( b ) . 
The microstructure of the spray - deposited alloy consists of primary Si particles with an average size of 12 . 5 ± 0 . 1 l m and the Al matrix ; no Al – Si eutectic is found in the alloy , as shown in Fig . 1 ( c ) and ( d ) . 
During the cooling step of the atomization process , a large number of fine semi - solid primary Si particles emerge in the droplets before depositing on the substrate [ 3 ] . 
The droplets impinge the substrate with a high speed and , as a result , they are remelted due to the latent heat of crystallization of the surrounding areas . 
During this process , the large primary Si particles can undergo cracking and fracture . 
The fractured Si phase can therefore lead to the increase of the nucleation sites . 
In the following solidification step , which displays lower cooling rate , there is enough time for the Si atoms to diffuse towards the primary Si that formed previously [ 20 , 21 ] . 
Accordingly , no eutectic Al – Si is found in the spray - deposited Al – 50Si alloy . 
Fig . 2 displays the XRD patterns of the Al – 50Si alloys produced using different techniques . 
All diffraction peaks can be attributed to Al or Si and no additional phases can be observed . 
The peaks of the Si phase for the deposited alloy are shifted to low angles compared with the cast material ( compare Fig . 2 ( a ) and ( b ) ) , indicating that the lattice parameter of Si increases as a result of the increases solid solubility of Al [ 22 ] . 
Therefore , it can be inferred that a Si ( Al ) solid solution is formed in the alloy after spray deposited alloy . 
This hypothesis is corroborated by Fig . 3 , which shows the EDS results for the primary Si phase . 
It is found that the amount of Al in Si in the deposited alloy is 2 . 39 ± 0 . 24 at . % , which is significantly higher than the cast alloy ( 0 . 41 ± 0 . 12 at . % ) . 
This result is in good agreement with the XRD patterns . 
Fig . 4 shows the typical microstructures of the spray - deposited Al – 50Si alloy after HIP at different temperatures . 
The phase composition after HIP is the same as observed for the parent spray - deposited alloy . 
The average size of primary Si increase lightly from 12 . 5 ± 0 . 1 l m for spray - deposited material to 12 . 7 ± 0 . 1 l m and 13 . 2 ± 0 . 2 l m after HIP at 793 and 843 K , respectively . 
Fig . 2 ( c ) and ( d ) displays the XRD patterns of the spray - deposited Al – 50Si alloy after HIP . 
The a - Al phase shift to high angles with increasing the HIP temperature compared with the as - deposited alloy ( Fig . 2 ( b ) ) , indicating that the lattice parameter decreases with increasing temperature as a result of the increased solubility of Si in Al . 
Fig . 5 shows the EDS results for the a - Al matrix in the different Al – 50Si alloys . 
The solubility of Si in Al increases with increasing the HIP temperature , corroborating the XRD results . 
Table 1 shows the density of the Al – 50Si alloys produced by different techniques . 
The density of the deposited alloy is lower than the cast alloy , and then it increases with increasing the HIP temperature . 
Fig . 6 shows the CTE curves resulting from the first heating step for the Al – 50Si alloys prepared under different conditions . 
All the curves show similar trend . 
The CTE increases linearly at low temperature and it shows a relatively sluggish increase at high temperatures . 
At low temperatures , no plastic deformation occurs in the Al matrix , and the expansion of the sample results from the combined expansion of the Al matrix and primary Si particle . 
As a result , the curves increase linearly with increasing temperature . 
However , the interfacial thermal stresses increase and the yield strength of the Al matrix decreases with increasing temperature . 
At high temperatures , when the thermal stresses are higher than the yield strength of the Al matrix , plastic deformation of the matrix may occur . 
Then , the expansion would result from the Al matrix , and primary Si particles as well as from the plastic deformation of the matrix , which may balance part of the expansion due to the Al and Si phases . 
Therefore , although the thermal expansion coefficient still increases at high temperatures , the variation is significantly smaller than at low temperatures . 
The CTE of the as - deposited specimen is much larger than the corresponding cast alloy ( Fig . 6 ) . 
This is in contrast to the investigations reporting that refinement the reinforcement particles and large amount of porosity tend to decrease the CTE [ 23 , 24 ] . 
This unusual phenomenon observed in the spray - deposited alloy can be attributed to the high cooling rate during processing . 
During deposition , a certain amount of Al atoms are dissolved into the primary Si phases , as shown in Fig . 4 . 
This is consistent with the experimental results hown in Fig . 6 . 
The CTE values of the samples after HIP are lower than the deposited alloy , but still higher than the cast alloy ( Fig . 6 ) . 
This is because the Al atoms in Si do not completely precipitate due to the low HIP temperature . 
On the other hand , the solid solubility of Si in Al increases with temperature and the concentration of Si in Al increases with increasing the HIP temperature . 
As shown in Fig . 5 , the concentration of Si in Al increases from 0 . 54 ± 0 . 08 at . % for the as - deposited alloy to 2 . 52 ± 0 . 11 at . % after 843 K HIP . 
The variations in the CTE of the different Al – 50Si alloys during the first and the second heating steps are shown in Fig . 7 as a function of temperature . 
The CTE obtained during the second heating is generally higher than that obtained for the first heating process . 
Similar results have been reported previously [ 24 , 28 , 29 ] . 
For example , Elomari et al . showed that the CTE in the second heating is higher for Al – SiC composites with particle size of 40 l m . 
Rohatgi et al . [ 29 ] observed that the CTE during the second heating was higher for Al - fly ash particles . 
They both attributed the increase of CTE in the second heating step to the emergence of thermal stresses . 
Large residual thermal stresses can cause appreciable matrix yielding during cooling from the fabrication temperature to room temperature due to the CTE mismatch [ 28 , 30 ] . 
In the present study , due to the inherent CTE mismatch between the Al matrix and the primary Si particles , large thermal stresses are induced in the alloy during cooling . 
For the Al – 50Si alloy , the thermal stresses generated around primary Si particles determined in the temperature range from 298 to 773 K is about 686 MPa , which is much higher than the value of the yield strength of pure Al [ 28 , 29 ] . 
Thus , during the CTE measurement , yielding takes place adjacent to the particles , which leads to the increase of the CTE during the second heating . 
Furthermore , Fig . 7 shows that the CTE of the as - deposited alloy during the second heating is smaller than the HIPed alloys . 
This indicates that large residual thermal stresses are generated in the HIPed alloys during the first cooling from 773 K . 
A summary of the physical properties of Al and Si is provided in Table 2 . 
Fig . 8 shows the comparison between calculated and experimental CTE of the different Al – 50Si alloys . 
The experimental CTE for the as - deposited ( Fig . 8 ( a ) ) and 793 K HIP ( Fig . 8 ( b ) ) alloys are smaller than that predicted by the Schapery model in the lower and higher temperature regimes , but it shows good agreement with the Schapery ’ lower bound in the temperature range between 423 K and 673 K . 
At higher temperature , the Turner model better describes the experimental findings . 
The porosity and the different size of the primary Si particles are possibly responsible for this phenomenon . 
The CTE of the 843 K HIP alloy is close to the Turner model ( Fig . 8 ( c ) ) . 
This alloy is completely densified after HIP , which fits well with the assumption of the Turner model . 
However , the experimental CTE of the cast alloy is smaller than both Schapery and Turner models . 
This can be ascribed to the coarse and irregular Si phases in the cast alloy that are not considered in these theoretical models . 
The microstructure and the thermal expansion behavior of spray - deposited , cast and HIPed Al – 50Si alloys have been investigated in detail . 
The following conclusions can be drawn : The microstructure of the as - deposited alloy is composed of primary Si with an average size of 12 . 5 l m and secondary Al phase . 
The CTE of the deposited alloy is higher than the cast alloy due to formation of Si ( Al ) solid solution ; On the other hand , the CTE of HIPed alloys are lower than the parent as - deposited alloy owing to the presence of an Al ( Si ) solid solution . 
The introduction of residual thermal stresses leads to higher CTE as a result of CTE mismatch between the Al matrix and the primary Si particles during the second heating . 
The experimental CTE for the as - deposited material and alloy HIPed at 793 K are in agreement with the lower bound of the Schapery ’ model in the temperature range from 423 to 673 K . 
The CTE of the 843 K HIP alloy is very close to the Turner model . 
Title : Spray Casting of Al - 25Si Alloy and Hot Deformation Behavior 
The spray forming process was used to produce Al - 25Si alloy in this study . 
The microstructure of the hypereutectic Al - 25Si alloy appeared to consist of Al matrix and equiaxed Si particles with average diameter of 5 ~ 7 µ m . 
To deduce the extrusion condition , a series of compression tests has been conducted at temperatures ranging from RT to 500 ° C . 
The strain rate sensitivity parameter ( m ) of this alloy has been found to be very low ( ≤ 0 . 1 ) below 300 ° C and reached maximum value of about 0 . 13 at 500 ° C . 
The extrusion has been successfully conducted at the temperatures of 300oC and above with the ratio of area reduction of 28 and 40 . 
The processing map for hot working has also been constructed . 
The composition of the present alloy was Al - 25Si ( wt . % ) . 
A 15 - kg - alloy - preform was prepared through the spray casting process with the melt temperature of 850oC . 
The diameter of the billet was 180 mm . 
After measuring the density distribution of billet specimens for compression test , and extrusion were taken from the center part of the billet , having over 97 % of the ideal density . 
The gauge dimensions of specimens were 4 mm × 4 mm × 6 mm . 
For extrusion , billets of 80 mm in diameter were machined . 
A series of compression was then carried out at the temperatures ranging from RT ( 24 ° C ) to 500 ° C under the various strain rates ranging from 10 - 4 / s to 10 - 2 / s . 
After constructing the diagrams of extrusion pressure vs . ram - speed from the compression test results , extrusion has been conducted under various conditions . 
The billet was sectioned through a plane with the rotation axis . 
Some pores were observed only in the bottom of the billet . 
The density measured by the Archimedes ’ method in the top and the middle parts of the billet was more than 97 % of its ideal density . 
Figure 1 shows the typical microstructure of the as - spray - cast billet together with that of IM processed Al - 25Si alloy . 
Coarse primary Si particles and AlFeSi based intermetallic phases are easily seen in the IM processed alloy , while the Si particles in the spray - cast alloy appear to be very uniform in their size ( ~ 6 µ m ) and distribution . 
The AlFeSi based intermetallic phases can also be observed in Fig . 1 ( b ) in the form of thin film type . 
The flow curves of strain rate vs . stress obtained from a series of compression tests conducted at temperatures from RT to 500 ° C are given in Fig . 2 in a log scale , plotting the flow stresses evaluated at the strain level of 1 % as a function of the initial strain rates . 
The flow stresses are observed to be very sensitive to the test temperatures . 
The slope of the flow curve is well known as the strain rate sensitivity parameter ( m ) , characterizing the strain rate dependency of the flow stress and also the measure of high temperature ductility [ 9 ] . 
The m values of spray - cast Al - 25Si alloy are found very small at lower temperatures less than 0 . 1 below 300 ° C but appear to increase remarkably reaching upto about 0 . 13 at 500 ° C . 
Figure 3 shows the relations between the extrusion pressure and ram - speed for the extrusion ratios of r = 28 and 40 , obtained from equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) using the flow data in Fig . 2 . 
During extrusion , it is necessary to control the working pressure below the endurance pressure of the machine . 
The critical pressure is evaluated as 1072 MPa in the case of this study and marked by the horizontal lines in Fig . 3 . 
A series of experimental extrusions were successfully conducted at the ram - speeds of 1 ~ 10 mm / s , for the extrusion ratios of r = 28 and 40 and at the various temperatures above 300 ° C . 
Microstructure observation after the extrusion revealed Si particles refined into an average size of about 2 µ m . As well known , the contours in processing map represent constant efficiency of power dissipation ( η ) , directly related to the relative rate of entropy production in the system , which is caused by a change in the microstructure . 
The dimensionless parameter η is obtained by comparing the dissipative characteristics of the work piece with that of a liner - dissipater and given by 2m / ( m + 1 ) , where m is the strain rte sensitivity of flow stress . 
Detail method of developing the map was given in the other literature on the basis of dynamic materials model [ 12 ] . 
The power dissipation maps were constructed from the compression test results as given in Fig . 4 , which is comparable to those of high strength wrought Al alloys such as 7075 and 8090 Al in the value of power dissipation efficiency [ 12 ] . 
The 180 - mm - diameter billet of a hypereutectic Al - 25Si alloy with over 97 % of ideal density , was produced using the spray casting process in this study . 
The Si particles were found to be uniform in both the distribution and their size . 
The strain rate sensitivity parameter ( m ) of this alloy has been observed to be very low ( ≤ 0 . 1 ) below 300 ° C but to reach the maximum value of about 0 . 13 at 500 ° C from a series of load relaxation and compression tests . 
The diagrams of ram - speed vs . extrusion pressure for this alloy were constructed from the compression test results , providing the extrusion conditions . 
The effectiveness of these diagrams has been confirmed experimentally by conducting extrusions under the various conditions . 
The processing map , which can be used as a guide for hot working , has been constructed . 
Title : Influence of temperature cycles on strength and microstructure of spray - deposited Si – Al CE9F alloy 
This paper investigates the effects of temperature cycles between − 55 ° C and 125 ° C ( the temperature range for intended space application ) on the strength and microstructure of spray deposited Si – Al CE9F alloy . 
After 500 cycles , the strength is significantly improved of 9 % ( i . e . , 26 MPa ) . 
Moreover the Weibull modulus also undergoes a significant increase . 
Microstructure characterizations by XRD , SEM , EBSD and DSC evidence recovery and recrystallization processes in the Al phase , and subgrain development at grain boundaries in the Si phase , leading to lower crystallite size . 
A Hall – Petch dependence of mean strength to average crystallite size in Si is proposed as strengthening mechanism . 
The spray deposited Si – Al CE9F alloy was prepared through atomization process by Osprey Metals Ltd ( Coombs and Dunstan , 1993 ) . 
Ninety 45 × 4 × 3 mm 3 specimens were machined and split into 5 batches intended for different heat treatments . 
A first reference batch of 29 specimens was used for characterizing the as - received material . 
Four batches of 10 or 20 specimens were subjected to 80 , 200 , 500 or 700 temperature cycles performed inside a thermal chamber . 
The cycles consist of 15 min dwell - times at − 55 ° C and 125 ° C , with heating and cooling rates of 20 K min − 1 . 
The microstructure of the as - received material consists of two interpenetrating phases of almost pure Si ( diamond cubic ) and Al ( face - centered cubic ) . 
Indeed , the position of the XRD peaks ( Fig . 1 ) matches the data for either pure Si or pure Al ( standard JCPDS cards No . 00 - 005 - 0565 and 00 - 004 - 0787 , respectively ) . 
Moreover , a comparison of the relative peak intensity for each phase indicates that the grains are macroscopically equiaxed in both phases . 
The two - phase microstructure resulting from spray - deposition is shown in Fig . 2 , where the silicon phase is in light gray and the aluminum phase in dark gray . 
A quantitative analysis of 60 optical microscope pictures ( × 1000 magnification ) taken in three perpendicular planes has shown that the material composition can be homogenized in a 200 μ m edge cube ( the composition assessed by image analysis is 59 . 74 ± 0 . 35 wt . % Si and 40 . 26 ± 0 . 35 wt . % Al ) . 
Moreover , from this analysis , the microstructure seems isotropic at this level . 
EBSD analyses of 200 × 150 μ m 2 areas provide an average grain diameter of 2 . 5 μ m in the Si phase and of 5 μ m in the Al phase . 
The distribution of Si grain diameter is quasi - uniform between 0 . 5 and 3 μ m and includes a few grains up to 10 μ m diameter . 
In the Al phase , the distribution is scattered with a lot of 2 μ m diameter grains and several large grains of diameter up to 15 μ m . 
It seems that the Al grain size is directly related to the gap available between the Si grains ( Fig . 3 ) . 
EBSD analysis of FIB polished surface ( 50 × 50 μ m 2 areas , Fig . 3 ) reveals low local misorientation inside the grains ( i . e . , lower than 0 . 5 ° ( Mohtadi - Bonab et al . , 2015 ) except in the vicinity of a subgrain boundary ) irrespective of the phase considered . 
The analysis of the misorientation at the grain boundaries in both Al ( Fig . 3c ) and Si ( Fig . 3d ) phases shows some subgrain boundaries with misorientation lower than 5 ° . 
The Si phase is characterized by the presence of coherent Σ 3 60 ° / < 111 > twin boundaries in almost each grain ( Fig . 3d ) . 
This kind of twin boundaries has a low surface energy ( 0 . 06 J m − 2 ) ( Phillpot and Wolf , 1990 ; Bristowe , 1998 ; Kohyama et al . , 1986 ) . 
Fig . 4a and b display IPF EBSD maps of large areas ( 200 × 150 μ m 2 ) in Al and Si for a sample mechanically polished . 
These results confirm that the Si phase is highly equiaxed at this scale . 
The Al phase seems to exhibit large areas of a few tens of μ m with similar crystal - lographic orientation ( cf . the green area at the bottom right of Fig . 4a , and the pink area at the top right of Fig . 3a ) even if the grains are not in contact in the image plane , and areas of fine equiaxed microstructure ( at the left of Fig . 3a or at the center of Fig . 4a ) . 
Such features were already evidenced in the microstructure of Si - Al CE7F by Hogg et al . ( 2006 ) . 
Fig . 4c and d display IPF EBSD map of large areas ( 200 × 150 μ m 2 ) in Al and Si for a sample mechanically polished after exposure to 500 temperature cycles between − 55 ° C and 125 ° C . 
The microstructure of the sample subjected to 500 temperature cycles is similar to the one of the as - received material in terms of grain size and crystallographic orientation . 
No quantitative comparison was possible with the available data concerning the fraction of subgrain boundaries in Al , the fraction of twin boundaries in Si , and local misorientation in both phases . 
However , the histogram of misorientation between two adjacent grains indicates that the number of subgrain boundaries in Si ( misorientation lower than 5 ° ) is about twice in Fig . 4d ( after 500 cycles ) than in Fig . 4b ( as - received ) . 
The mean four - point bending strength for each batch is plotted in Fig . 5 versus the number of temperature cycles . 
A significant increase of 9 % , from 283 MPa up to 309 MPa , is evidenced between 0 and 500 cycles . 
The trend of the curve is not linear : an increase of 5 % is already achieved after 80 cycles . 
Between 500 and 700 cycles , no significant change is evidenced , which indicates that the phenomena leading to strength increase do not occur any more after such numbers of temperature cycles . 
Table 1 reports mean , minimum and maximum values of the strength for each batch , as well as the Weibull parameters for 0 , 80 and 500 cycles , for which at least 20 values are available , allowing a proper identification ( Nohut , 2014 ) . 
During the first 80 cycles , mean , minimum and maximum values increase in the same way , as well as σ 0 , whereas the Weibull modulus remains unchanged . 
Between 80 and 500 cycles , the increase in average strength is still significant , but the maximum value and scale parameter only slightly increase , and the minimum value does not change anymore . 
Moreover the Weibull modulus significantly increases , indicating that the strength distribution is narrower . 
The experimental strength distributions after 0 , 80 , 200 , 500 and 700 cycles are plotted in Fig . 6 , as well as the identified Weibull curves for 0 , 80 and 500 cycles . 
The shift toward higher values of the Weibull curve illustrates the increase in strength with the number of temperature cycles . 
The assessment of residual stresses in the Al phase by sin 2 ψ method provides compressive normal stress values about 20 ± 5 MPa and shear stress values of 5 ± 2 MPa for 0 , 200 , 500 and 700 temperature cycles and does not evidence any significant change in the residual stress level with the number of temperature cycles . 
It is noteworthy that the re - sidual stress value is of the order of magnitude of the yield stress of pure aluminum ( between 10 and 20 MPa for purity of 99 . 99 and 99 . 8 % respectively ( Davis , 1993 ) , which indicates that the Al phase has probably undergone plasticity mechanisms during the elaboration of the material . 
The Williamson – Hall analysis of the XRD spectra provides an assessment of the average crystallite size and the average lattice strain from Eq . ( 2 ) , and therefore the dislocation density from Eq . ( 3 ) , in both Al and Si phases . 
These data are plotted respectively in Fig . 7a , c and e versus the number of temperature cycles . 
For comparison purpose , the same data are plotted in Fig . 7b , d and f for samples subjected to heat treatment at 130 ° C for 20 , 50 and 125 h . 
These heat treatments correspond to the time spent at the maximal temperature during 80 , 200 and 500 cycles respectively . 
The results obtained with heat treatments at 200 ° C are identical to those obtained after heat treatments at 130 ° C and are not reported here . 
The average crystallite size in the Si phase decreases of about 30 % during the first 200 cycles and seems to stabilize after 500 cycles with a total decrease close to 35 % ( Fig . 7a ) . 
On the other hand , it seems to stabilize after only 20 h at 130 ° C , with a total decrease close to 25 % ( Fig . 7b ) . 
In the Al phase , the average crystallite size continuously increases with the number of temperature cycles , and achieves an increase of 90 % after 700 cycles ( Fig . 7a ) . 
Heat treatments at 130 ° C lead to an increase of only 65 % after 20 h and a stabilization afterwards ( Fig . 7b ) . 
It is noteworthy that the average crystallite size in both phases is more than one order of magnitude lower than the grain size assessed in Section 3 . 1 . 
The lattice strain in Si phase strongly decreases of about 30 % after 200 temperature cycles and then more slightly to achieve a decrease of 44 % after 700 temperature cycles ( Fig . 7c ) . 
Heat treatment at 130 ° C implies a decrease of 29 % after 20 h , but the lattice strain does not change anymore afterwards ( Fig . 7d ) . 
In the same way , the lattice strain in the Al phase decreases of about 38 % after 200 temperature cycles and 50 % after 700 temperature cycles ( Fig . 7c ) , but remains quite constant during heat treatment at 130 ° C ( Fig . 7d ) after a very low decrease for the first 50 h . 
The dislocation density in the Si phase , assessed from the previous data using Eq . 
( 3 ) , does not undergo any significant change either during temperature cycling ( Fig . 7e ) or during heat treatment at 130 ° C ( Fig . 7f ) . 
On the other hand , in the Al phase , the dislocation density exponentially decreases with the number of cycles , with a decrease of 40 % after 80 temperature cycles and 74 % after 700 temperature cycles ( Fig . 7e ) . 
After 20 h at 130 ° C , the dislocation density has dropped of 50 % and does not undergo any change afterwards ( Fig . 7f ) . 
Fig . 8 compares the DSC thermograms obtained with the as - received material and with a sample previously subjected to 500 temperature cycles . 
Whereas no significant signal is noticeable for the sample subjected to 500 cycles , the as - received material exhibit two exothermic phenomena . 
The first one is spread around 150 – 200 ° C and is of low magnitude and the second one is more sharp and manifests as a peak above 400 ° C . 
Similar results were reported for a strain hardened ( H19 ) commercial 1XXX series alloy in ( Hildebrandt , 1979 ) . 
The low temperature signal consists of several overlapped peaks and is attributed to recovery 
processes . 
The high temperature peak is attributed to recrystallization . 
Recovery peaks were also reported for a recycled aluminum alloy subjected to severe plastic deformation by equal channel angular pressing between 90 and 200 ° C ( attributed to recovery ) , between 200 and 300 ° C ( attributed to recrystallization ) and between 300 and 350 ° C ( attributed to grain growth ) ( Rebhi et al . , 2011 ; Makhlouf et al . , 2012 ) . 
The results of Fig . 8 thus indicate that not only recovery processes , but also recrystallization may have occurred in the Al phase during the 500 temperature cycles since the high temperature peak is not present after 500 cycles . 
The enthalpy corresponding to the first recovery peak between 125 and 250 ° C is about 0 . 03 J g − 1 ( assuming a nominal composition of 40 wt . % Al in the DSC sample ) . 
This value lies in the range reported in ( Rebhi et al . , 2011 ) , between 0 . 01 and 0 . 06 J g − 1 . 
Compressive residual stresses of about 20 ± 5 MPa have been assessed in the Al phase irrespective of the number of temperature cycles . 
This value is close to the yield stress of pure aluminum ( Hildebrandt , 1979 ) and indicates that the Al phase has probably undergone plastic deformation during the elaboration process . 
This is supported by the dislocation density about 10 14 m − 2 in the Al phase ( as - received material ) . 
The compressive state of stress in Al probably develops during hot isostatic pressing , because the coefficient of thermal expansion of Al is higher than the one of Si ( 23 × 10 − 6 K − 1 for Al and 2 . 5 × 10 − 6 K − 1 for Si at 25 ° C ) , what would lead to tensile stresses in Al phase during cooling down to room temperature . 
The identical results obtained by Williamson - Hall analyses after heat treatments at 130 and 200 ° C indicate that the static recovery phenomena are similar in this temperature range and that they are complete after 20 h at 130 ° C and a fortiori at 200 ° C . 
These recovery phenomena are probably related to the first DSC peak spread between 125 and 250 ° C while scanning at 20 K min − 1 ( Fig . 8 ) , and attributed to recovery in ( Rebhi et al . , 2011 ; Makhlouf et al . , 2012 ) . 
These static recovery phenomena manifest by a large increase of the average crystallite size and a large decrease of dislocation density , but only a low decrease of the lattice strain . 
Thanks to cyclic thermomechanical stresses induced by the mismatch of coefficients of thermal expansion , temperature cycles are able to activate dynamic recovery mechanisms that continue the static recovery process . 
This results in further reducing lattice strain and dislocation density and by increasing the average crystallite size . 
The DSC thermograms indicate that the phenomena occurring during temperature cycles , involve mechanisms related to recrystallization since the high temperature peak ( above 400 ° C ) related to recrystallization ( Hildebrandt , 1979 ) has almost fully disappeared after 500 temperature cycles ( Fig . 8 ) . 
It is noteworthy that recrystallization in super - purity aluminum has been reported at temperature as low as 200 ° C ( Perryman , 1954 ) or 250 ° C ( Huang and Humphreys , 1999 ) . 
These static and dynamic recovery phenomena seem to interact during temperature cycles as suggested by the different microstructures obtained after 80 temperature cycles and after 20 h at 130 ° C . 
Indeed , the increase in the average crystallite size is lower and the decrease in lattice strain is higher , after 80 temperature cycles than after 20 h at 130 ° C , despite exposure to cyclic thermomechanical stresses in addition to equivalent thermal exposure . 
However after 200 cycles and 50 h at 130 ° C , the microstructural features obtained by Williamso - Hall analysis are about the same and correspond to the stabilized state after heat treatment at 130 ° C or 200 ° C , which should indicate that the static recovery mechanisms are over . 
The additional microstructure changes occurring after more than 200 cycles are therefore mainly dynamic and involve recrystallization phenomena . 
In the investigated temperature range , dislocation motion in Si is much more difficult ( Priester , 2006 ) than in Al and is not relevant to explain the changes revealed by Williamson – Hall analyses , as confirmed by the almost constant dislocation density provided by Eq . ( 3 ) ( Fig . 7e and d ) . 
However the fraction of subgrain boundaries ( misorientation lower than 5 ° ) is about twice after 500 temperature cycles than in the as - received material ( cf . Section 3 . 2 . 1 ) , and this result is corroborated by the decrease in average crystallite size . 
The rapid cooling of the droplets of molten Si during spray forming might have generated crystal defects such as dislocations , twins , but also vacancies and disordered or ill - defined grain boundaries . 
These latter defects are likely to reorganize and create subgrains with well - defined boundaries instead of ill - defined grain boundaries . 
Such a phenomenon is consistent with the microstructural changes reported here , i . e . , increase in the fraction of subgrain boundaries and decrease of both average crystallite size and lattice strain . 
The characteristics of Al and Si phase microstructure follow close trends ( i . e . , identical results obtained by Williamson – Hall analyses during heat treatments at 130 and 200 ° C , slow down of microstructural changes after 200 temperature cycles , and similar values of average crystallite size and lattice strain after either 80 – 200 cycles or heat treatment for 20 – 50 h ) . 
Together with the previous assumption that changes in Si phase is mainly related to grain boundaries , this could indicate that the interfaces between Al and Si phases are , at least partially , the locus of microscopic changes in Si . 
The average strength of the material undergoes an important increase up to 80 – 200 cycles , and then still increases slowly up to 500 – 700 cycles . 
Such a two - step trend matches the microstructure changes in the Al and Si phases , as described in Sections 4 . 1 and 4 . 2 . 
However , the strength value , about an order of magnitude higher than the yield stress of pure aluminum ( Davis , 1993 ) , and the brittle behavior of the material ( Mauduit et al . , 2016 ) indicate that CE9F fracture is mainly related to the Si phase . 
Indeed , the temperature of brittle to ductile transition in Si is above 500 ° C ( Hirsch and Roberts , 1991 ) . 
The main fracture mechanism in silicon is cleavage along { 111 } planes ( Savage et al . , 1993 ) . 
Evidences of such a fracture mechanism in Si - Al CE9F alloy have been reported in Mauduit et al . ( 2016 ) ( cleavage planes in fracture surfaces ) . 
It is well known from the early work of Petch ( 1953 ) that the Hall – Petch effect is relevant to describe the grain - boundary strengthening of materials undergoing brittle fracture by cleavage . 
Even if the grain size assessed by EBSD does not change with temperature cycles , the strengthening can be related to the decrease of the crystallites size evidenced by the Williamson - Hall analyses . 
Indeed the subgrain size is sometimes the quantity that controls the mechanical properties instead of the grain size ( Ghassemali et al . , 2015 ; McQueen and Hockett , 1970 ) . 
The plot of average strength as a function of average crystallite size ( Fig . 9 ) shows a reasonable agreement of the experimental data with the Hall - Petch law , in view of the dispersion of the results . 
Temperature cycles between − 55 and 125 ° C ( in - use temperature range of space embedded systems ) induce significant changes in the microstructure and strength of the Si - Al CE9F alloy prepared by spray - deposition . 
Recovery and recrystallization occur in the Al phase with a large decrease of the dislocation density . 
Rearrangement at the grain boundaries ( and probably at the interfaces between Al and Si phases , in view of the simultaneous microstructure changes in both phases ) occurs in the Si phase , which leads to a decrease in the average crystallite size . 
By Hall - Petch effect , the Si substructure refinement gives rise to an improvement of up to 9 % of the strength after 500 cycles , and a lower dispersion of strength values . 
Most of these microstructure changes mainly occur between 80 and 200 temperature cycles , and are also observed after heat treatment at 130 ° C for 20 h . 
However , microstructure changes are higher after 500 temperature cycles than after heat treatment . 
This highlights the role , in the mechanisms a work , of the thermomechanical stresses , induced by the mismatch of coefficient of thermal expansion in Al and Si phases . 
Even if the mechanisms at work are still hypothetic and must be further investigated , these results could be exploited to propose a new step in the processing route of chip boxes , in view of a lightening of the components thanks to higher mechanical properties . 
A suitable heat treatment has to be optimized by investigating the effects of heat treatment prior to or in place of temperature cycles . 
Title : Microstructural characterization of in situ TiC / Al and TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg composites prepared by spray deposition 
An innovative spray - deposition technique has been applied to produce in situ TiC / Al and TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg composites . 
This technique provides a new route to solve the problems of losses and agglomeration of the reinforcement particles when they are injected into the spray cone of molten droplets during spray forming process . 
Experimental results have shown that the presence of needle - like Al 3 Ti and Al – Si – Fe compounds , which are detrimental not only to the fracture toughness , but also to the stability of the microstructure , can be eliminated completely from the final product by using a proper Ti : C molar ratio of 1 : 1 . 3 in the Ti – C – Al preforms and adding 5 wt % TiC particles to Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg alloy . 
Moreover , another major problem of coarsening of silicon particles usually encountered in the hypereutectic Al – Si alloys has also been solved by the technique . 
The silicon particles in the spray - deposited 5 wt % TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg composite were much refined ( ~ 2 μ m ) compared to those ( ~ 5 μ m ) obtained in the matrix alloy without TiC addition . 
The formation and elimination mechanisms of Al 3 Ti phase in TiC / Al composites can be explained based on thermodynamic theory . 
The modification of the microstructures in the spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg alloy can be interpreted in the light of the knowledge of atomic diffusion . 
The experimental results also showed that the ultimate tensile strength of the TiC / Al composites was improved over that of the unreinforced Al matrix . 
First , stoichiometric reactant ( Ti and C ) and an appropriate amount of matrix ( Al ) powders were mixed thoroughly . 
The compositions of the elemental powders used in this research are 4979 presented in Table 1 . 
The powder mixture was mechanically pressed into cylindrical preforms with a green density of 50 – 60 % . 
Two base materials are used in the present work . 
One is commercial purity aluminum ( approximate composition : 99 . 7 wt % Al , 0 . 15 wt % Si , 0 . 15 wt % Fe ) and the other is an Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg ( wt % ) alloy . 
The use of commercial purity aluminum as a base alloy has an advantage that the composite products are relatively simple , which is beneficial for elucidating the characteristics of the process . 
An amount of about 2 kg base material was melted and the melts were superheated to 900 ° C in an induction furnace . 
Then , 3 or 5 wt % reactant blocks were inserted into the molten base materials . 
When all reactions were completed ( the end point of the reaction can be determined after observing the dazzling light originated from the reacted melt ) , the melts were degassed by using C 2 Cl 6 at 730 ° C . 
The processes were carried out in air . 
The composite slurry is then atomized and deposited . 
The spray - deposition processing parameters are briefly summarized as follows . 
The melts were superheated to 820 ° C and atomized using nitrogen gas at 0 . 8 MPa pressure . 
The atomizer – substrate distance was 390 mm , and a delivery tube with a diameter of 3 . 3 mm was used . 
The liquid slurry is disintegrated into micro - size composite droplets which are deposited on to a substrate and collected as bulk TiC / Al and TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg composites . 
The spray - deposited specimens had a cylindrical disc shape with a diameter of about 120 mm . 
The microstructure of the spray - deposited specimens was revealed by etching in a solution of mixed acids ( 2 ml HF + 3 ml HCl + 5 ml HNO 4 + 250 ml H 2 O ) . 
The polished and etched specimens were examined under a CAMBRIDGE S360 scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) fitted with an energy - dispersive X - ray ( EDX ) analysis system . 
X - ray diffraction ( XRD ) analysis was carried out with a Rigaku diffractometer using Cu K α radiation ( 40 kV / 25 mA ) . 
Fine microstructural features were evaluated using an H - 800 transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) operated at 120 kV . 
TEM disc - shaped specimens were prepared by using ion - beam thinning at a current of 0 . 5 mA and an inclination angle of 12 ° . 
The tensile properties of the TiC / Al composites were examined using an MTS - 810 test machine at a constant crosshead speed of 0 . 5 mm / min . 
Tensile testing specimens with a 3 mm gauge width and 3 mm gauge length were tested at room temperature . 
Fig . 1 shows a typical SEM microstructure of the spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg alloy , which is mainly composed of a - Al , plate - shaped Si ( dark gray ) and needle - like second phases ( light gray ) . 
The Si particles have an average size of 5 μ m . 
The needle - like second phase , being randomly distributed in the matrix , was about 2 – 5 μ m in length , as shown in Fig . 1 . 
EDX analysis showed that the needle - like second phase contains elements of Al , Si and Fe [ 44 ] . 
XRD was performed to identify the second phase and the result is shown in Fig . 2 . 
Analysis of the diffraction pattern shows that the needle - like phases are a mixture of tetragonal d - Al 4 FeSi 2 and monoclinic b - Al 5 FeSi compounds . 
In other words , the metastable d - Al 4 FeSi 2 and equilibrium b - Al 5 FeSi compounds co - exist in the spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg alloy . 
The presence of d - Al 4 FeSi 2 and b - Al 5 FeSi in the needle - like compounds was further confirmed by electron diffraction . 
Figs . 3 and Fig . 4 gave two examples of diffraction pattern analysis for the needle - like compounds . 
The TEM results are in good agreement with the XRD results , as shown in Fig . 2 . 
No notable difference in the morphology between d - Al 4 FeSi 2 and b - Al 5 FeSi compounds can be found , as shown in Figs . 3 and 4 . 
By means of XRD , the phases in the TiC / Al composite were analyzed , and the experimental results are shown in Fig . 5 ( a ) . 
In addition to the expected TiC and Al peaks , one can see that Al 3 Ti peak is also present in the alloy . 
Al 3 Ti is observed to be in strip or rectangular structure with a mean size over 20 μ m [ 45 ] , which will be detrimental to the plasticity of the composites . 
In our previous work [ 45 ] , we found that the tensile elongation of the 3 wt % TiC / Al composite with Al 3 Ti was only 4 % that is much lower than the value of unreinforced aluminum ( 20 % ) , as shown in Table 2 . 
Moreover , the higher the Ti content , the more strip or rectangular Al 3 Ti phase intends to form in the composite . 
It indicates that the titanium content with a ratio of Ti : C = 1 : 1 may be slightly excessive . 
Therefore , other experiments were performed with a Ti to C molar ratio of 1 : 2 ( Fig . 5 ( b ) ) . 
It shows that Al 3 Ti is absent in the final product within the precision of the X - ray method . 
Al 4 C 3 and C peaks , however , are present in the composite . 
It shows that the carbon content in the preforms with Ti : C = 1 : 2 is relatively excessive . 
Al 4 C 3 is certainly not a desirable constituent in the composites as it is also a brittle compound that decomposes readily when exposed to atmospheric moisture . 
Furthermore , the fluidity of the melt was found to be severely impaired when it was processed within the Al 4 C 3 - formation range [ 46 ] . 
Fig . 5 ( c ) , ( d ) shows the XRD patterns of the composites with the Ti to C molar ratios of 1 : 1 . 8 and 1 : 1 . 5 , respectively . 
Al 4 C 3 and C peaks are still present in the composite with Ti : C = 1 : 1 . 8 , as shown in Fig . 5 ( c ) . 
The reacted preforms in which the Ti to C molar ratio was 1 : 1 . 5 were taken out immediately when all reactions were completed ( the end point of the reaction can be determined as mentioned above ) . 
The use of reacted preform as a sample has an advantage that some phases , especially with a small amount , can be characterized by XRD . 
Fig . 5 ( d ) shows the phases of the reacted preform ( powders ) with Ti : C = 1 : 1 . 5 . 
Al 4 C 3 and C peaks are still present in the reacted powders even though their peaks are very weak . 
Fig . 6 represents a typical SEM microstructure of the composite with a Ti to C molar ratio of 1 : 1 . 2 . 
With the increase of Ti to C molar ratio ( from 1 : 1 to 1 : 1 . 2 ) , the strip or rectangular Al 3 Ti was enormously decreased . 
An optimum carbon content in Ti – C – Al preforms with Ti : C = 1 : 1 . 3 was finally determined . 
Under such a condition , no Al 3 Ti , Al 4 C 3 and residual C can be found in the final product within the precision of the X - ray method ( Fig . 5 ( e ) ) . 
It shows that the phase constitution consists of Al and TiC in the composites . 
OM photomicrograph of the 3 wt % TiC / Al composite is shown in Fig . 7 . 
No Al 3 Ti , Al 4 C 3 and residual graphite can be found in the composite and that the composite has sound structure . 
The tensile elongation of this composite was 10 % ( Table 2 ) , much higher than the value of the composite with Al 3 Ti ( 4 % ) . 
Moreover , improvement in tensile elongation of the composite was accompanied by an increase of the ultimate tensile strength ( UTS ) ( Table 2 ) . 
TEM examination of the composites indicates that the majority of the fine TiC particles fabricated with this technique are equiaxed ( Fig . 8 ) . 
Clearly , the negative impact of the equiaxed TiC particles on plasticity of the composite is less than that of the composites reinforced by sharp particles . 
Based on the results of successfully eliminating Al 3 Ti , Al 4 C 3 and residual graphite in the TiC / Al composites , we prepared spray - deposited TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg composites . 
Fig . 9 shows typical SEM microstructures of the spray - deposited 3 and 5 wt % TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg composites . 
It is readily seen that the distribution of TiC particles is uniform . 
Essentially , this can be attributed to the combined effect of the disintegration of a molten stream into micro - size droplets during atomization and the minimized particle migration in a mushy layer present during deposition . 
It is worth noting that the TiC addition leads to the change of microstructure of the needle - like ternary Al – Si – Fe compounds . 
With the addition of 3 wt % TiC particles , the needle - like compounds were decreased ( Fig . 9 ( a ) ) . 
While the compounds were eliminated completely from the final product when 5 wt % TiC particles were added ( Fig . 9 ( b ) ) . 
Table 2 compares the mechanical properties of the spray - deposited TiC / Al composites . 
The results indicated that the TiC / Al composites exhibit relatively higher strengths than the value of unreinforced aluminum . 
For example , as shown in Table 2 , the UTS of the spray - deposited commercial Al is 124 MPa , whereas 3 wt % TiC / Al composites with and without Al 3 Ti have values of 137 . 1 and 148 . 6 MPa , respectively . 
As expected , the tensile elongations ( El ) of the composites are reduced significantly as a result of the presence of ceramic reinforcements . 
As mentioned previously , d - Al 4 FeSi 2 and b - Al 5 FeSi phases are always present in the spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg alloy . 
The b - Al 5 FeSi phase has a monoclinic crystal structure with lattice constants of a = 6 . 12 Å , b = 6 . 12 Å , c = 41 . 5 Å and α = 91 ° , which is less symmetric and more complex than tetragonal d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase with lattice constants of a = 6 . 12 – 6 . 16 Å and c = 9 . 48 – 9 . 49 Å [ 55 ] . 
According to the Al – Si – Fe ternary phase diagram [ 56 ] , the primary solidifying phase is d - Al 4 FeSi 2 . 
The transformations L → d - Al 4 FeSi 2 and L → d - Al 4 FeSi 2 + Si occur at about 710 ° C . 
Below 610 ° C , the formed d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase transforms into the b - Al 5 FeSi phase . 
At about 576 ° C , the ternary eutecticum consisting of the α - Al , Si and b - Al 5 FeSi phase is reached . 
The formation of b - Al 5 FeSi phase in this transformation is known to be very slow [ 56 ] . 
After the first stage of transformation , d - Al 4 FeSi 2 is surrounded by b - Al 5 FeSi which is a reaction product . 
Further transformation can only occur through solid state diffusion which is very slow . 
In Al – Si – Fe – Cu – Mg alloy , a more complex sequence of phase transformation occurs . 
For this alloy , there is no appropriate equilibrium phase diagram available . 
It is well known that the sequence of equilibrium solidification events can - not be followed in spray - deposited hypereutectic Al – Si – Fe – Cu – Mg alloys . 
According to the SEM , EDX and XRD results , we could assume that the solidification of the spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg alloy droplets occurs in the following sequence . 
In the beginning of solidification , meta - stable d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase is crystallized , then primary Si nucleates on the d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase and grows . 
It has been confirmed by Timmermans et al . [ 57 ] . 
Finally , the remaining liquid solidified into an irregular ternary eutectic of a - Al , Si and d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phases . 
Zhou and Duszczyk [ 58 ] noted that , except for the Si phases ( including eutectic phase and primary Si crystals ) , the metastable d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase was predominant in the spray - deposited microstructure and the volume fraction of the equilibrium b - Al 5 FeSi phase was relatively small . 
The high volume fraction of metastable d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase in the spray - deposited microstructure may be attributed to two primary reasons . 
First , the tendency of metastable phase formation in Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg alloy is relatively strong . 
Therefore , extensive precipitation of the d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase should occur during the atomization stage . 
Second , the kinetics associated with the metastable - to - equilibrium phase transition in this alloy is relatively sluggish . 
The reason for the formation of b - Al 5 FeSi phase is associated with the thermal condition of impinging droplets . 
The solidification process during spray - deposition occurs in two stages : gas atomization ( rapid cooling ) and droplet consolidation ( relatively slow cooling ) . 
In case of gas atomization , the d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase is able to form within droplets to some extent before deposition . 
Upon droplet deposition , an abrupt fall in solidification rate occurs within the deposited layer . 
At this time , the d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase originated from the droplets can be readily transferred into the stable b - Al 5 FeSi phase due to slow cooling ( or annealing ) effect and the fact that d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase is extremely metastable . 
The basic principle of the innovative spray - deposition technique for making TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg composites is that the submicron TiC particles are produced in situ in a molten alloy by exothermic reactions between elements . 
TiC has high melting point and is thermodynamically very stable . 
TiC has been synthesized in the melt matrix before the metastable d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase is crystallized . 
From Fig . 8 , one can see that all TiC particles within the matrix are significantly refined compared with the original graphite and titanium particles . 
The starting carbon particles were as large as 50 mm , while the TiC particles are less than 0 . 7 mm in reacted preforms . 
Most importantly , the fine TiC particles are not only round in shape but also very uniform in size , which strongly indicates that the formation of TiC is achieved via a mechanism of nucleation and growth [ 45 , 59 ] . 
Moreover , the TiC particles with a fine submicron size and with a narrow size distribution suggest that their nucleation be easier than their growth . 
The reason why the addition of in situ TiC particles can modify microstructures of the spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg alloy may be attributed to the following factors . 
First , the presence of TiC particles increases the nucleation kinetics of d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase by increasing the density of nuclei in the melt , which is beneficial to the formation of fine d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase . 
Second , the impacting of melt droplets containing TiC particles into the semi - solidified layer during spray - deposition made initially formed d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase with a needle like morphology to be broken into small particles , which decreased the size of d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase and increased its number of solidification nuclei . 
Third , the addition of 5 wt % TiC particle creates a high volume fraction of dispersed particles which are broken up during redistributed on a fine scale at grain and subgrain boundaries , as well as within grains . 
These may act effectively as sinks for vacancies and obstacles to the diffusion of silicon atoms over a long distance , particularly along the grain and subgrain boundaries with which the TiC particles interact . 
As a result , the growth of silicon particles becomes difficult and their coarsening rate is relatively reduced . 
It has been shown that the silicon particles dispersed in the matrix alloy have a strong propensity to coarsening when they are exposed to high temperatures [ 60 , 61 ] , which may in turn promote the recrystallization of the matrix . 
The fact that silicon particles can be refined by in situ formed TiC particles in the Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg alloy is very important for the processing and application of hypereutectic Al – Si alloys . 
According to the experimental results mentioned above , one can see that in addition to providing dispersion strengthening and modifying matrix microstructure , the addition of TiC particles may also play an important role in delaying the coarsening of silicon particles in the hypereutectic Al – Si alloys . 
More recently , we found that the sharp angled block Al 6 Fe phase in spray - deposited Al – Fe – V – Si alloys can be also substituted by spherical phase by adding TiC particles in the alloys [ 62 ] . 
This indicates the novel spray - deposition technique , based on our present investigation , may find application in some areas where the microstructures of modification are required such as in spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg and Al - Fe - V - Si alloys . 
The strengthening behavior of spray - deposited MMCs is related to factors such as reinforcement volume fraction , matrix strength and temper condition . 
Ibrahim et al . [ 63 ] compared the strength values of spray - deposited monolithic alloys and MMCs to those of equivalent materials produced using ingot metallurgy ( IM ) and powder metallurgy ( P / M ) and obtained three important conclusions . 
First , when compared with the IM alloy , the spray - deposited MMCs and unreinforced matrix exhibit a higher strength . 
The strength of the P / M formed MMCs is , however , greater than that of the spray - deposited materials . 
Lavernia [ 64 ] and Ibrahim et al . [ 63 ] attributed the higher strength that is commonly observed in P / M formed MMCs to the refined matrix microstructure and the presence of a dispersion of oxide particles . 
Second , under the conditions of lower matrix strength , the incorporation of ceramic reinforcements generally leads to improved strength . 
This is evidenced by the higher strength of the spray - deposited 6061 / SiC MMCs relative to that of the unreinforced matrix after the T4 temper [ 65 ] . 
Third , when the matrix is treated to a higher strength , the incorporation of SiC reinforcements may lead to either strengthening or weakening depending on the reinforcement volume fraction . 
For example , under the T6 temper condition , the strength of the MMCs is lower relative to that of the unreinforced materials at lower reinforcement volume fractions ( e . g . , ⬍ 17 vol . % ) . 
It is , however , higher than that of the unreinforced matrices at high reinforcement volume fractions ( e . g . , ⬎ 17 vol . % ) . 
As shown in Table 2 , the UTS of the TiC / Al composites at room temperature was improved over that of the unreinforced Al matrix . 
The adequate improvement in strength may be attributed to the strong interfacial bonding between the TiC particles and the Al matrix . 
Lavernia and Wu [ 65 ] suggested that there should be a critical reinforcement volume fraction , above which incorporation of reinforcements leads to strengthening , and below which reinforcements lead to weakening . 
The fluidity of a composite slurry , however , decreases with increasing particle volume fraction using this method . 
Consequently , at high reinforcement volume fractions , it may be difficult to deliver the composite slurry into a gas atomizer . 
Viscosity , therefore , presents a limit to the volume fraction of reinforcements that can be successfully incorporated using this method . 
Obviously , the spray - deposition processing parameters , including superheat , atomizer – substrate distance , delivery tube diameter , and gas / liquid ratio must be further optimized . 
A novel spray - deposition technique , with which TiC particles are formed by in situ reactions in matrix melt , has been successfully applied to produce TiC / Al and TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg composites . 
This technique provides a new route to solve the problems of agglomeration and losses of particles associated with the traditional spray - deposition MMCs processing technique . 
The needle - like Al 3 Ti phase is always present in TiC / Al composites when the Ti : C molar ratio is 1 : 1 in the preforms . 
The brittle Al 3 Ti phase can be eliminated entirely from the final product by using a proper Ti : C molar ratio of 1 : 1 . 3 in the Ti – C – Al preforms . 
The microstructure of spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg alloy is composed of the a - Al , plate - shaped Si and the needle - like second phases . 
Experimental results have shown that the presence of the needle - like compounds can be eliminated completely with the addition of 5 wt % TiC particles to the alloy . 
It may be attributed to the fact that the presence of TiC particles increases the nucleation kinetics of d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase by increasing the density of nuclei in the melt and that the impacting of melt droplets containing TiC particles into the semi - solidified layer during spray - deposition made initially formed needle - like δ - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase to be broken into small particles . 
The silicon particles in the spray - deposited 5 wt % TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg composite were much refined ( ~ 2 mm ) compared to those ( ~ 5 mm ) obtained in the matrix alloy without TiC addition . 
The refinement of silicon particles indicated that the addition of TiC particle could create a higher volume fraction of dispersed particles , and act effectively as sinks for vacancies and obstacles to the diffusion of silicon atoms over a long distance . 
As a result , the coarsening rate of silicon particles is relatively reduced . 
The UTSs of the TiC / Al composites were improved over that of the unreinforced Al matrix . 
title : Effect of copper and iron on the wear properties of spray formed Al – 28Si alloy 
In the present study the effect of copper ( Cu ) and iron ( Fe ) on the wear behavior of spray formed Al – 28Si alloy has been investigated . 
The spray formed Al – 28Si alloy exhibited equiaxed grain morphology with ﬁ ne and uniform distribution of Si particles in Al matrix and spray formed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy exhibited similar morphology with small needles of β - Al4FeSi intermetallics and globular shaped θ - Al2Cu precipitates spread along the boundaries and junctions of grains . 
Hot pressing has considerably reduced the porosity in spray formed alloys . On the contrary the microstructure of as - cast Al – 28Si alloy consisted of coarse primary and eutectic Si unevenly distributed in Al matrix and that of as - cast Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy consisted of coarse Si particles , long needles of β - Al4FeSi2 and θ - Al2Cu phases in Al matrix . Spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy exhibited higher value of hardness compared to the other alloys . 
The wear behavior of these alloys under dry sliding conditions showed that the spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy exhibited maximum wear resistance and minimum coef ﬁ cient of friction , while as - cast Al – 28Si alloy showed minimum wear resistance and maximum coef ﬁ cient of friction over the entire range of loads . 
The high wear resistance of spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy is explained in light of its microstructural modi ﬁ cations induced during spray forming and the topography of worn surfaces . 
The chemical composition of Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys is shown in Table 1 . The details of spray forming set up employed in the present study have been described elsewhere [ 9 ] . In brief , spray forming process employed an annular convergent – divergent nozzle to create a spray of melt . 
In each run 2 . 5 kg of alloy has been melted to a temperature of 800 ° C in a resistance heating furnace . 
The molten metal is atomized by a free fall atomizer using nitrogen ( N2 ) gas . 
The resultant spray is deposited over a Cu substrate resulting in a near net shaped preform . 
The process variables employed for producing the preforms are listed in Table 2 . Specimens of size 100 × 30 × 20 mm were cut from the preforms . The specimens were hot pressed at a pressure of 55 MPa and a temperature of 480 ° C for densi ﬁ cation . 
The density of spray formed alloys was measured by using Archimedes principle as per ASTM : B962 - 08 . 
The percentage of porosity ( % P ) in the spray formed alloys was measured by using the actual density ( ρ ac ) and the theoretical density ( ρ th ) of the alloys using the relation , % P = [ 1 - ( ρ ac / ρ th ) ] × 100 . 
Samples were extracted from as - cast , as - spray formed and spray formed + hot pressed Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys for microstructural examination . 
The samples were prepared by polishing using standard metallographic techniques of grinding on emery paper with 1 / 0 , 2 / 0 , 3 / 0 and 4 / 0 speci ﬁ cations . 
Final polishing was done on a wheel cloth using brasso and kerosene . 
The polished samples were etched with Keller ’ s reagent ( 1 % vol . hydro ﬂ uoric acid ( HF ) , 1 . 5 % vol . hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) , 2 . 5 % vol . nitric acid ( HNO3 ) and rest water ) . 
The microstructures of samples were examined under a ZEISS Optical Microscope and Scanning Electron Microscopy ( Model : S - 3400N Hitachi Model ) . 
Wear tests were conducted on all the alloy specimens on a pinon - disk wear testing machine ( Model : TR - 20 , DUCOM ) as per ASTM : G99 - 05 . 
The counterpart disk was made of quenched and tempered EN - 32 steel having a surface hardness of 65HRC . 
Wear specimens of size Ø 8 × 30 mm were machined out from all the alloys . 
The specimens were polished and then cleaned with acetone before conducting the test . 
The wear tests were conducted by varying the load from 10 to 70 N at a sliding velocity of 1 . 5 m / s and a sliding distance of 1025 m . 
The worn surfaces of wear specimens were examined under Scanning Electron Microscopy . 
The hardness of the alloys was measured by Vickers Hardness Tester ( Mattoon ATK - 600 ) at an applied load of 300 g as per ASTM : E384 - 11e1 . 
Fig . 1a shows the microstructure of as - cast ( AC ) Al – 28Si alloy . 
It consists of primary and eutectic Si phases in the α - Al matrix . 
The primary Si particles exhibited a plate like morphology with a size varying from 75 to 350 μ m , while eutectic phase comprises of Si needles . Fig . 1b depicts the microstructure of as - spray formed ( SF ) Al – 28Si alloy . 
The microstructure consists of an equiaxed , nearly spheroidized grain morphology of α - Al matrix . 
The Si particles are very much re ﬁ ned having a size varying from 2 to 15 μ m , and are uniformly distributed in the Al – matrix . 
A porosity of 14 % was observed in the as - spray formed alloy . 
An equiaxed , homogeneous , and uniform distribution of primary Si phase and modi ﬁ ed eutectic phase in Al – matrix of as - spray formed alloy can be obtained due to abundant nucleation of the melt due to rapid cooling in the ﬂ ight and on deposition . 
The semi solid droplets are fractured due to inter particle collision in the spray during ﬂ ight and upon impinging on a substrate . 
Also due to remelting of the solid component of the spray in the top surface region of the deposit effectively break the Si particles that are formed prior to the deposition stage [ 10 , 11 ] . 
The presence of such Si phase leads to an increase in the density of nuclei in the top layer of the as - spray formed alloy [ 12 ] . The microstructure of spray formed and hot pressed alloy shown in Fig . 1c exhibited a ﬁ ner matrix , fragmentation of Si phase , lower porosity of 7 % and enhanced density of the alloy . The acicular eutectic structure in the as - cast alloy seems to be at variance with short and blunted structure in the corresponding as - spray formed alloy ( Fig . 1b ) . 
The optical microstructure of as - cast Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy is shown in Fig . 2 . 
A relatively slow cooling rate associated with casting process develops coarse microstructural features of the alloy . The microstructure consists of block like grey primary Si particles and ternary β - Al4FeSi2 intermetallic sharp edged white rod / needles having a length ranging from 150 to 250 μ m and θ - Al2Cu phase in Al matrix . 
The Energy Dispersive X - ray ( EDX ) spectra of various phases present in the microstructure as indicated by the points in Fig . 2 are shown in Fig . 3 . 
The various phases are α - Al ( point 1 ) , primary Si ( point 2 ) , θ - Al2Cu ( point 3 ) and β - Al4FeSi2 ( point 4 ) . 
The β - phase is naturally a hard and brittle precipitate with a needle form , which usually acts as a stress raiser and interferes with liquid ﬂ owing in the interdendritic channels during solidi ﬁ cation [ 13 ] . 
Cu was found to exist mainly in the interdendritic Al2Cu phase seen around the Al4FeSi2 phase as Chinese script . 
Fig . 4a shows the microstructure of as - spray formed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy . 
It consists of uniformly distributed spherical shaped Si particles having an estimated mean size of 10 μ m in the α - Al matrix . In addition , no banded microstructure was observed in this alloy . The spherical morphology and non - connected distribution of pores have been observed in the as - spray formed alloy . 
Approximately 15 % porosity was found which suggests that the formation of pores occurred due to the incorporation of included gas , a well described phenomenon caused by an excessive presence of liquid during the spray generation [ 14 ] . 
The EDX spectra of various phases present in the microstructure as indicated by the points in Fig . 4a are shown in Fig . 5 . 
The various phases are α - Al ( point 1 ) , θ - Al2Cu ( point 2 ) , β - Al4FeSi ( point 3 ) and primary Si ( point 4 ) . The primary Si particles are uniformly distributed in the a - Al matrix . 
The bright phase could be identi ﬁ ed as θ - Al2Cu precipitates with globular morphology around very small needle type intermetallics with β - Al4FeSi . After hot pressing , the alloy showed partially re - crystallized grains together with elongated grains and a strong reduction in porosity to 4 % ( Fig . 4b ) . 
The primary Si particles are further fragmented in to smaller particles and are distributed uniformly in the Al matrix . 
The results of hardness measurement are shown in Table 3 . 
It is observed that the hardness of the spray formed alloys are higher than that of as - cast alloys . 
Also the hardness of Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe spray formed alloys are higher than that of Al – 28Si spray formed alloys . 
The higher hardness of as - spray formed Al – 28Si alloy can be attributed to the microstructural re ﬁ nement in primary Si phase owing to the rapid solidi ﬁ cation effect . 
In case of as - spray formed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy , apart from the re ﬁ nement of primary Si , the re ﬁ nement of Al4FeSi and Al2Cu phases have imparted a higher hardness to the alloy . 
A further increase in the hardness was observed in the spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si alloy due to the partial recrystallization , fragmentation and redistribution of primary Si phase in α - Al matrix and reduced porosity . 
In spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy apart from the re ﬁ nement of primary Si and reduced porosity , the fragmentation and redistribution of secondary phases ( β - Al4FeSi and θ - Al2Cu ) further increased the hardness of the alloy . 
The microstructural changes from as - cast to spray formed and hot pressed alloys , could lower the stress concentration at the interface of the Al4FeSi particles and α - Al matrix . Therefore , the tendency to initiate the subsurface cracks is reduced resulting in a higher hardness [ 15 ] . 
The wear characteristics of Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys for a range of applied load at a sliding velocity of 1 . 5 m / s and a sliding distance of 1025 m are shown in Fig . 6a . 
The load is varied from 10 to 70 N . 
It is observed from the Fig . 6a that the wear rate is increasing with increase in the load for all the alloys irrespective of the alloy processing condition . 
In the entire range of applied load , among both the alloy compositions the spray formed + hot pressed ( SF + HP ) alloys showed better wear resistance than the as - cast alloys . 
Comparative study of wear behavior of binary and quaternary alloy compositions revealed that the spray formed + hot pressed ( SF + HP ) Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy has got better wear resistance than that of spray formed + hot pressed ( SF + HP ) Al – 28Si alloy under identical sliding conditions . 
The wear resistance is highest for spray formed + hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy and lowest for as - cast Al – 28Si alloy . 
Obviously the size of primary Si has a great in ﬂ uence on the wear rate of these alloys . 
During the wear tests , the coarse Si phases fractured more frequently than the ﬁ ne Si phase [ 16 ] . 
As the load increases , the shear stress in the alloy increases which in turn increases the amount of fracture in Si phase and the deformation of the matrix in the surrounding area of Si . The stress concentration resulting from such deformation may critically depend on the size of Si particles and will be more severe at the interface between coarse Si particles and the matrix compared to that between ﬁ ne Si particles and the matrix . 
This is observed in the present study where the coarse Si phases fractured readily thereby decreasing the wear resistance of the as - cast alloys . 
Spray forming has re ﬁ ned the primary and eutectic Si into ﬁ ne particulates which are distributed uniformly in the α - Al matrix . 
In case of as - spray formed alloys the wear rates are little higher than that observed in spray formed + hot pressed alloys . 
The reason may be due to the presence of pores in the former alloys . 
Among the alloy compositions , the wear resistance of Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys is higher than that of Al – 28Si alloys . 
The addition of alloying elements Cu and Fe to Al – 28Si has improved the wear resistance of Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys . 
The wear resistance of quaternary as - cast alloy is higher than that of binary as - cast alloy . 
This is because of the reason that the quaternary alloy consists of β - Al4FeSi2 and θ - Al2Cu phases . The β - phase is basically hard and increases the hardness of the alloy there by increasing the wear resistance [ 14 ] . 
The θ - phase provides strengthening effect to α - Al matrix that reduces the chances of peeling off of coarse Si plates from the matrix there by improving the wear resistance [ 15 ] . 
The wear resistance of spray formed and hot pressed quaternary alloy is higher than that of as - cast quaternary alloy . 
This is due to the re ﬁ nement of long needles of β - Al4FeSi2 phase and Chinese script like θ - Al2Cu phase in to ﬁ ne needles in the α - Al matrix . 
Also the plate like primary and needle like eutectic Si phases have been broken down to ﬁ ne particulates of Si that have been uniformly distributed in the α - Al matrix . 
Hot pressing of as - spray formed alloy has further fragmented the Si , β and θ phases into ﬁ ne particles there by increasing the wear resistance of the alloy . 
Fig . 6b depicts the friction plot of Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys . 
The coef ﬁ cient of friction is found to be more or less constant in all the alloys but the coef ﬁ cient of friction of spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy is the lowest and that of as - cast Al – 28Si alloy is the highest . 
The worn surfaces of Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys at a load of 70 N are shown in Fig . 7 . 
The worn surface of as - cast Al – 28Si alloy specimen shown in Fig . 7a clearly indicates the mark of an adhesive wear with plastic deformation . 
The gross plastic ﬂ ow of metal , metallic fracture of ridges , edge cracking and large dimples can be seen on the worn surface of the as - cast alloy . The block - like primary Si particles are more easily detached from matrix and the debris of Si particles is embedded in the matrix , resulting in deep and non - uniform grooves . 
Typical surface damage , abrasive scoring marks , deeper and wider craters are also clearly observable . 
As seen in Fig . 7c the worn surface of as - spray formed Al – 28Si alloy shows smooth appearance with small grooves due to plastic deformation on the surface and oxidation of asperities , indicating the existence of mixed metallic and abrasive wear . The low wear rate of the as - spray formed alloy compared to as - cast alloy is attributed to the microstructural re ﬁ nement and large amount of ﬁ ne and uniformly distributed Si particles in α - Al matrix . 
With increasing load , the fragmentation of Si particles and their ability to support the load results in the direct contact of matrix with the counter face and a large strain within the α - Al matrix adjacent to contact surfaces . 
This might lead to the subsurface crack growth and delamination . 
The broken ﬁ ne hard Si particles entrapped between the counter face and the alloy may act as third - body abraders that may be responsible for the ﬁ ne longitudinal grooves on the worn surface . 
The worn surface of spray formed + hot pressed Al – 28Si alloy shown in Fig . 7e reveals pronounced smooth sliding marks containing shallow grooves with smaller width ridges and few small dimples . 
The smaller width is due to the re ﬁ nement of the primary Si phase caused during hot pressing . 
For the material with higher hardness , abrasive wear tends to take place , while for material with lower hardness adhesive wear is encountered [ 17 ] . 
In the present study , for spray formed + hot pressed alloy with hardness value 116 , abrasive wear has been found to be the main mechanism , while for as - cast alloy with hardness value 67 , adhesive wear has taken place . 
Thus , it can be said that the wear mechanism may also depends on the hardness of the material . 
The worn surfaces of Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys are shown in Fig . 7b , d and f . 
The worn surfaces of all the alloys are less damaged compared to that of Al – 28Si alloys . 
The reason is due to addition of Fe and Cu alloying elements to Al – 28Si alloy . 
The β - phase is hard and increases the hardness of the alloy and θ - Al2Cu phase provides strengthening effect to Al matrix there by reducing the chances of peeling off of Si phase from the Al matrix . 
This again improves the wear resistance of the alloy . 
The surface damage observed in asspray formed alloy is lesser than that of as - cast alloy . 
This is due to the re ﬁ nement of Si , β - phase into ﬁ ne needles and θ - phase into ﬁ ne particles in the as - spray formed alloy . 
The surface damage observed in spray formed and hot pressed alloy is lesser than that observed in as - spray formed alloy . 
This is because of further fragmentation of Si , β and θ phases into ﬁ ner particles and reduction of porosity due to hot pressing . 
The as - cast alloy is characterized by deep scoring marks . 
This is less in as - spray formed alloy and still lesser in spray formed and hot pressed alloy . 
The following conclusions may be drawn from the present study on the spray forming and hot pressing of Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys : 
( 1 ) Spray forming is effective in re ﬁ ning the microstructures of Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys . 
Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy consisted of ﬁ ne and uniform distribution of β - Al4FeSi2 and θ - Al2Cu phases along with primary Si particles in Al matrix . 
( 2 ) Hot pressing has reduced the porosity by 50 % in Al – 28Si and 73 % in Al – 28Si – 5Cu - 4Fe alloys . 
( 3 ) Spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy showed highest hardness value of 160VHN compared to as - spray formed and as - cast alloys . 
( 4 ) Addition of Cu and Fe increased the wear resistance of Al – 28Si alloy . 
The wear resistance is highest and the coef ﬁ cient of friction is lowest for spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy compared to as - spray formed and as - cast alloys . 
Title : Properties and microstructure of Al – 11Si / SiCp composite coatings fabricated by thermal spray 
Thermal spraying has been used to coat 6082 - T6 aluminium alloy with aluminium matrix composites . Mixtures of Al – 11Si powder and 20 vol . % SiC and 40 vol . % SiC particles in the powder feeder were used as spraying material . 
In some conditions , SiC particles were coated with a sol – gel silica coating , which acts as an active barrier enhancing the wettability of the reinforcement by molten aluminium reducing the porosity of the composite coatings and inhibiting the formation of aluminium carbide . 
Coatings with a reinforcement volume fraction up to 17 vol . % ( for 20 vol . % SiC in feeder ) and 27 vol . % ( for 40 vol . % SiC in feeder ) were obtained with porosities below 1 . 0 % . 
In all cases , the incorporation of sol – gel silica coatings on SiC particles reduced the porosity and increased the reinforcement volume fraction and the hardness of the coatings . 
The role played by the different spraying parameters has been also studied . 
The spraying material was fabricated by mixing metallic particles and ceramic ones to spray composite coatings . 
The metallic powder was an Al – 11Si spray powder from Sulzer , i . e . an aluminium alloy that contained approximately 11 . 4 % Si ( measured chemical composition in weight % : Cu = 0 . 01 , Fe = 0 . 14 , Mn b 0 . 01 , Mg = 0 . 01 , Si = 11 . 4 , Zn b 0 . 01 , others : 0 . 03 and Al = bal . ) with a particle mean size of 80 μ m . 
This powder was mixed with SiC in form of particles ( SiCp ) that were fabricated by Navarro S . A . ( Spain ) with a mean size of 52 μ m , which acted as reinforcement in the coatings deposited . 
Feedstock powders with 20 and 40 % in volume of uncoated SiCp and sol – gel coated SiCp were prepared by a conventional rotating ball milling machine using alumina jar and balls . 
Ball milling was carried out in air for 15 min with a ball - to - powder weight ratio of 1 : 1 , ﬁ lling 25 % of jar volume . 
Afterwards , particles were directly used in the thermal spraying equipment . 
The substrates used were 6082 - T6 aluminium alloy with dimensions of 50 × 25 × 5 mm ^ 3 . 
The substrates were sand blasted by corundum prior to thermal spraying to enhance the adhesion of the coating . 
The sol – gel coating was obtained following the next steps : a sol was prepared from TEOS ( tetraethylorthosilicate ) diluted in absolute ethanol 1 : 11 and distilled water 1 : 5 . 
This mixture hydrolysed for 2 h at room temperature under acid conditions to a sol concentration of 204 g L - ^ 1 . 
This procedure was selected after testing of various alternative concentrations , catalysts and precursors . 
Particles were then placed in the sol and stirred for two hours . 
They were then ﬁ ltered and cleaned with distilled water and ethanol , followed by drying for 1 h at 120 ° C to evaporate water and constrained ethanol . Finally , samples were heated at 500 ° C for 1 h more to evaporate organic compounds and to condensate the silica coating [ 13 , 14 ] . 
The spraying was carried out with an oxy - acetylene thermal spray coating system from Castolin ( DS8000 with a SSM40 modulus ) which provided a thermal power of 28 kW by mixing oxygen at 4 bar and 2000 L / h with acetylene at 0 . 7 bar and 1800 L / h . 
The spraying distance , the feeding rate and the number of layers used are shown in Table 1 . 
In all cases a neutral ﬂ ame and a relative speed between gun and substrate of 10 mm / s were used . 
After the spraying procedure , the coated material was let to cool down in air to room temperature . 
The thicknesses of the coatings obtained were in the 0 . 5 to 2 mm range . 
To coat big ﬂ at surfaces , parallel layers have been applied with a lateral displacement of the position of the spraying gun relative to the sample of 1 cm , which implies an overlap of about 20 % of the ﬁ rst coating laid . 
The maximum thickness of the sprayed coating appears in front of the spraying gun and it reduces when moving in the perpendicular direction . 
Because of this , the total thickness of the samples fabricated with two spraying layers was higher but not doubled the thickness of single sprayed ones . 
Samples for microscopy were prepared from the transversal section of the coating and observed in Light Microscope ( LM ) and Scanning Electronic Microscope ( SEM ) ( Philips ESEM XL30 ) with an Energy Dispersive X - ray spectrometer ( EDX ) . 
Porosity and reinforcement percentages were measured with image analysis software on the SEM images . 
Hardness test were carried out using a Vickers Buehler Micromet 2103 micro - hardness tester with loads in the range from 0 . 3 to 2 kg . 
Porosity , reinforcement rate and hardness have been measured in all cases to determine the effect that the different spraying powder mixtures and parameters have in the coating . 
Their effect in the thermal substrate hardness has been also evaluated to determine if their T6 arti ﬁ cial ageing has been modi ﬁ ed . 
4 . 1 . 
Spraying of composite coatings with sol – gel coated SiC particles 
The Al – 11Si pre - alloyed powder particles showed the characteristic morphology of gas atomized alloys , i . e . there were ﬁ ne spherical particles forming clusters along with other ﬁ ne particles adhered as satellites at the surface of coarser particles ( Fig . 1a ) . 
The size of the Al – 11Si powder was similar to that of SiCp used . 
The thickness of the solgel silica layer was 0 . 7 μ m [ 17 ] , so it did not have relevant effects in the size or shape of SiCp ( Fig . 1b ) . 
The oxy - acetylene thermal spraying technique has allowed fabricating coatings from different power mixtures : pure Al – 11Si metallic powder , Al – 11Si mixed with 20 vol . % and 40 vol . % of SiCp and Al – 11Si mixed with 20 vol . % and 40 vol . % of sol – gel silica coated SiCp . 
The transversal sections of some of the samples show that the coatings were homogeneous and compact with thicknesses in the 500 and 2000 μ m range and that SiCp were integrated in the aluminium alloy , although the amount of porosity and reinforcement was very dependent on the spraying conditions and on the use of SiCp or sol – gel coated SiCp ( Fig . 2a and b , respectively ) . 
Fig . 2c and d shows a detail of the integration of SiC particles and the matrix . 
It can be seen that the porosity in the interface is lower for the sol – gel coated SiCp than without sol – gel coated SiCp . 
Fig . 3 resumes the porosity and reinforcement rates obtained for the different sprayed coatings ( the number of each column refers to conditions indicated in Table 1 ) to show the effect of the percentage and type of reinforcement particles used . 
The effect of spraying distance , feeding rate and number of layers is analyzed in following sections . 
It can be observed that in most cases the porosity was smaller than 6 % and that it strongly depended on the spraying parameters ; in the unreinforced coating any modi ﬁ cation of the spraying conditions caused porosity to increase up to 15 % ( Fig . 3a ) . 
The addition of particles to the spraying mixture reduced by a large extent the porosity of the coatings ; in the worst case the porosity kept at a reasonable 6 % and values below 1 % were obtained for different spraying conditions . 
In general , considering mean values , the use of sol – gel coatings on the SiCp reduced further the porosity by 25 % as compared with using bare SiCp for the same spraying conditions , and porosity was similar for the 20 vol . % and 40 vol . % sprayed mixtures . 
The real reinforcement rates achieved in the coatings ( Fig . 3b ) was less sensitive to the spraying parameters than porosity . 
The maximum reinforcement rates obtained were 17 vol . % for mixtures containing 20 vol . % SiCp and 27 vol . % for 40 vol . % SiCp mixtures . 
The incorporation of sol – gel silica coatings on the particles increased the reinforcement rates by 10 % , in average . 
The lower transference ef ﬁ ciency of SiCp to the coatings as compared with Al – 11Si powder was partially due to their lower kinetic energy because of its smaller size and higher density ( 3 . 18 g / cm3 vs 2 . 77 g / cm3 ) . 
The other factor that caused the reduction of the coating reinforcement rate was that SiCp cannot directly stick to the substrate . Once some aluminium particles have been deposited at the substrate , the SiCp can adhere to the splats . 
However , if the amount of SiCp at the surface of the sprayed layer is high , the incorporation of more particles will ﬁ nd dif ﬁ culties . 
These phenomena imply that a part of the sprayed particles will always be lost and that there will be a maximum reinforcement rate achievable with this technique . 
There are practical limitations in the deposition of composite coatings from powder mixtures , but the adequate selection of the spraying parameters allowed obtaining reasonably high reinforcement rates while keeping low the porosity of the coating and , although the feeding rate , the number of spraying layer deposited and ﬁ gures evidence that the highest hardness was obtained for the material fabricated with the mixture containing 40 vol . % of sol – gel coated SiCp ( open circles ) and that hardness was higher in the materials containing sol – gel coated SiCp ( open symbols ) that in those sprayed with the as - received SiCp ( closed symbols ) . 
The comparison of Fig . 4a and b evidences that the hardness of the fabricated coatings had a stronger dependency with the reinforcement rate ( Fig . 4a ) than with porosity ( Fig . 4b ) . 
The powder feeding rate is the processing parameter that is the most related with the productivity of a technique and it is much related with the microstructural characteristics of the coating . 
To determine its relevance we have analyzed the morphological characteristics of coatings fabricated with two layers using the same spraying parameters ( in both cases the distance used was 18 cm ) but the amount of material sprayed per time unit , i . e . the feeding rate . 
As it can be observed in Fig . 5 , in the unreinforced coating , the Al – 11Si the splats were more spherical for 1 . 4 g / s feeding rates ( Fig . 5a ) than for the spraying distance are relevant for the quality of the coating , the use of modi ﬁ ed particles by depositing a sol – gel silica layer was the key modi ﬁ cation to optimize the coatings features ( Fig . 3 ) . 
To determine the combined effect of porosity and of reinforcement particles , hardness test were made . 
Its relationship with reinforcement rate and porosity is shown in Fig . 4a and b , respectively . 
These 0 . 8 g / s ( Fig . 5b ) . 
This happened because there was more powder to be heat , so the temperature reached by each particle was lower and it deformed less at its collision with the sample surface . 
In the case of spraying composite coatings , the incorporation of SiCp in the powder mixture visibly reduced the porosity of the coating ( Fig . 5c and d ) at all feeding rates . 
The presence of hard SiCp in the spraying powder may have helped to deform and break the aluminium - silicon splats , limiting the formation of pores between them at the coating . 
Fig . 6 resumes the porosity and reinforcement rates ( Fig . 6a and b , respectively ) measured for the coatings sprayed at two different feeding rates ( 0 . 8 and 1 . 1 g / s ) . 
In all cases , the porosity was higher when spraying the coatings at higher feeding rates , causing an increase of 32 % porosity in the case of Al – 11Si powder and of 27 % when using the highest feeding rate for both tested mixtures of SiCp and Al – 11Si . 
The reinforcement rates achieved increased while increasing the powder feeding rate ( Fig . 6b ) . 
In the case of 0 . 8 g / s feeding rate , only 52 % of the SiCp were adhered during spraying for both mixtures tested , while the amount of particles effectively adhered to the coating in the case of 1 . 1 g / s feeding rate was above 65 % , i . e . the real reinforcement increased by 17 % . 
This behaviour can be explained by means of the evolution of the coating during its spraying ; the higher amount of sprayed material pushes the previously sprayed material and reduces the possibility of badly adhered SiCp to falling down from the coating . 
Hardness testing showed that increasing the feeding rate reduced the hardness of the sprayed coating by 8 % in nearly all cases ( Fig . 7 ) . For the pure Al – 11Si alloy , the hardness reduction was expected as it is caused by the increased porosity of the layer . 
In the case of composite coatings , there were two competing effects , as increasing the feeding rate increased both the porosity of the coating and the reinforcement rate . 
Hardness tests showed that the role played by porosity was much more relevant than that of the slight reinforcement rate enhancement . 
However , the use of mixtures with higher SiCp percentages always led to higher hardness values for the same spraying conditions . 
When coating big surfaces , it is always necessary to overlap coating layers to avoid leaving uncoated zones . 
We have sprayed the different materials using the same spraying conditions ( 20 cm of spraying distance and an 1 . 1 g / s feeding rate ) , and we have overlapped the spraying layers by 20 % . 
For this conditions the thickness of the coating for the single sprayed layer was 500 μ m ( Fig . 8a ) and due to the overlapping of layers the coating the thickness of the coating increased by 50 % to 750 μ m ( Fig . 8b ) . 
In the one layer coating the porosity was distributed all across the thickness of the layer , while when two layers were deposited the porosity almost disappeared in the inner and central part of the coating . 
This is an effect of the mechanical impact of the particles sprayed in the second layer , which was favoured by the higher temperature of the coating reached during the second spraying . 
This implied a higher thermoplastic response of the ﬁ rst and second coatings which allowed reducing their porosity . 
Porosity reduced by about 30 % by spraying two layers ( Fig . 9a ) and the reinforcement rates were up to 45 % higher ( Fig . 9b ) , as compared with spraying only one layer . 
This can be explained because SiCp cannot directly adhere to the substrate , so the ﬁ rst layer acted as bond coat easing the formation and adhesion of a highly reinforced coating . There is also a preheating effect of the ﬁ rst coating that favours the adhesion of the SiCp . 
In all cases , hardness increased in the two layer system because of the reinforcement rate increase and porosity reduction ( Fig . 10 ) , showing the same dependence with the powder mixtures used as indicated in previous sections . 
The spraying distance is generally considered as one of the clue parameters to obtain dense coatings . 
We have observed in the transversal sections that the outer part of the coatings was better consolidated for the layer sprayed at the largest distance ( Fig . 11b ) than at shorter ones ( Fig . 11a and c ) . 
There was a reduction in the porosity from 1 . 9 % to under 0 . 75 % for coatings sprayed at 16 cm and 20 cm , respectively ( Fig . 12a ) , obtaining porosity values that are lower than those obtained with other techniques [ 6 – 8 ] . 
On the other hand , the spraying distance did not have in ﬂ uence in the reinforcement rates of the coatings ( Fig . 12b ) . 
The hardness values obtained for the 20 % SiCs – g sprayed at the largest distance were higher than for the other conditions ( Fig . 12c ) . This can be explained by the melting of the sprayed coating that took place during the spraying at the shortest distance , which allowed the formation of big spherical pores formed by trapped gases and to its slow cooling ( Fig . 11c ) , and by the favoured reactivity of the sol – gel coating with the Al – Si alloy . 
One of the key features of thermal spraying is that it can be usually considered as a nearly cold technique , i . e . that the input heat can be controlled to avoid modifying the structure of the substrates . In the case of spraying on low melting temperature substrates , such as aluminium alloys , this cannot be easily assumed because temperatures above 300 ° C can be reached , causing thermal ageing of the substrate . 
We used the AA6082 with a T6 treatment , i . e . solubilised at 530 ° C and arti ﬁ cially aged for 8 h at 176 ° C , with a hardness of 109 HV . 
The hardness measured in the substrate after the spraying procedure for the same spraying distance of 18 cm are plot in Fig . 13 . 
The hardness test was made across the transversal section at four distances from the coating for each material and condition tested . 
The hardness of the substrates was homogenous in all zones ( scattering of results was less than 6 % ) , indicating that the samples suffered the same thermal treatment because of the high thermal conductivity of aluminium . 
The softer substrates were obtained after spraying the unreinforced material ; increasing the proportion of particles in the feeding mixture or reducing the powder feeding rate reduced the hardness loss suffered by the samples . 
Finally , depositing two layers was the spraying condition that most reduced the hardness of the substrates . 
All these phenomena have the same origin ; the hardness was lost by an overaging of the hardening Mg2Si precipitates formed during the arti ﬁ cial ageing of the samples , which grows with the increase of input heat to the substrate . 
Therefore , the highest the ef ﬁ ciency of the heat transferred from the spraying gun to the sample , the highest the reduction of hardness caused by means of the thermal treatment applied . 
The aluminium powder absorbs more heat than the SiC particles and transfers it more ef ﬁ ciently to the substrate , causing the highest hardness reduction in the coatings deposited without SiCp ; a similar phenomenon took place when higher powder feeding rates were used . 
Obviously , applying two layers meant a higher input heat to the substrate . 
Aluminium matrix composite coatings with an Al – 11Si matrix and SiC particles reinforcement have been successfully prepared by oxyacetylene thermal spraying on aluminium alloy substrates ; the effect of the main spraying parameters on the characteristics of the coatings and the optimum spraying conditions have been determined . 
During the spraying a part of the SiCp from the feeding mixture was lost , and the coatings had reinforcement rates of about 16 vol . % when the spraying mixture contained 20 vol . % of SiCp and 27 vol . % when spraying mixtures with 40 vol . % SiCp . 
When the mixture feeding rate was increased , the reinforcement degree and the porosity increased . 
Reducing the spraying distance caused an increase in the porosity of the layer because of an excessive input heat , but it did not affect the reinforcement degree of the coating . 
The reinforcement degree obtained after depositing two layers was higher than after one because of the favoured adherence of SiCp to aluminium splats than to the aluminium alloy substrate and by the preheating effect of the ﬁ rst layer deposited . 
The porosity obtained was also lower after the application of the second layer . 
In all conditions studied , using sol – gel silica coatings on SiCp reduced the porosity of the coatings to values below 1 % because it enhanced the wettability of the reinforcement by molten aluminium , and also increased the degree of reinforcement of the coatings obtained . 
The spraying treatment modi ﬁ ed the properties of the 6082 - T6 aluminium alloy used as substrate because of the input heat , leading to the loss of the T6 condition . 
To reduce this effect , the use of low feeding rates , mixtures with high SiCp percentages and depositing only one layer is recommended . 
However , the size of the substrate sample has a critical in ﬂ uence in the heat transfer conditions of the technique , so it must be optimized for each practical application . 
Title : Microstructural features induced by spray processing and hot extrusion of an Al – 18 % Si – 5 % Fe – 1 . 5 % Cu alloy 
An inert gas atomization technique was employed to produce spray deposits of an Al – 18Si – 5Fe – 1 . 5Cu ( wt . % ) alloy . 
The spray - deposited alloy was subsequently hot extruded with a reduction ratio of 6 : 1 and extrusion temperature of 480 ° C . 
The microstructural features of the as - spray - deposited and extruded alloys were examined using optical , scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy techniques , and chemical analyses of phases were carried out using energy dispersive X - ray analysis and spectroscopic methods . 
The microstructure of the spray - deposited alloy revealed the presence of a cellular and plate - like morphology of b - Al 5 SiFe phase coexisting with d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe phase in contrast to the presence of only d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe phase in atomized powder particles . 
The formation of the b - Al 5 SiFe phase is suggested to arise as a result of phase transformation of d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe phase during slow cooling of the spray deposit . 
The hot extrusion of the alloy resulted in fragmentation of both intermetallic phases and Si into nano - sized particles . 
The microstructure evolution during spray deposition and hot extrusion of the alloy is discussed . 
Alloy corresponding to the nominal composition Al – 18Si – 5Fe – 1 . 5Cu ( wt . % ) was prepared by melting 4 N purity Al with high - purity Si , Fe and Cu in a graphite - bonded fireclay crucible . 
A schematic of the spray atomization and deposition process is shown in Fig . 1 . 
The details of the spray - forming setup have been discussed elsewhere [ 29 , 34 ] . 
In brief , the experimental setup consisted of a nozzle assembly , an atomization chamber and a control system to maneuver the movement of the deposition substrate . 
The atomization of the melt was carried out using an annular confined gas atomization nozzle centered around a melt flow tube [ 34 ] . 
A resistance - heating furnace was used for preheating the tundish to avoid premature freezing of the melt . 
The alloy was melted in a graphite crucible and the melt was superheated to 975 ° C in a resistance - heating furnace prior to its atomization . 
The melt temperature was recorded using a chromel – alumel thermocouple with an accuracy in temperature control to within ± 2 ° C . 
The atomization chamber was purged with N 2 gas before the melt was poured into the tundish of the atomization assembly preheated to a temperature of 200 ° C . 
Gas flow was subsequently initiated to promote atomization of the melt . 
The spray was allowed to deposit over a cast iron substrate to achieve a coherent and dense alloy preform . 
The amount deposited in each run was about 1 . 2 kg . 
The oversprayed powder particles were collected from the atomization chamber and cyclone collector . 
Cylindrical samples of 25 mm in diameter and 50 mm in length were machined out from each spray deposit obtained . 
Subsequently , hot extrusion of the as - deposited alloys was carried out using an extrusion ratio ( ER ) of 6 : 1 ( area reduction ) at a temperature of 480 ° C . 
The chemical composition of the spray - formed alloy was analyzed using the X - ray fluorescence technique ( SRS3400 , Bruecker , Germany ) . 
The alloy was found to contain 17 . 890 % Si , 5 . 190 % Fe , 1 . 632 % Cu , 0 . 007 % Cr , 0 . 004 % Mn , 0 . 012 % Mg , and the balance Al . 
This is very close to the nominal composition of the alloy . 
Several samples were machined from the center and peripheral regions of the as - deposited and hot - extruded alloys for microstructural examination . 
The samples were polished following standard metallographic procedures and etched with Keller ’ s reagent ( 95 % H 2 O – 2 . 5 % HNO 3 – 1 . 5 % HCl – 1 % HF , by volume ) . 
The microstructure of the samples was examined using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ; JEOL JSM 840 , 20 kV ) and optical microscopy ( Leitz instrument ) . 
Samples for transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) study of spray - deposited and extruded alloy were prepared from a thin slice of about 50 lm glued on a tripod for mechanical polishing [ 48 ] . 
The mechanical polishing was performed using successive grinding with diamond plastic films of different roughness ( 15 , 6 , 3 , 1 , 0 . 5 lm grains ) and syton , a solution of colloidal silica with 20 nm grains , on a rotating polisher kept under water . 
A specimen thickness of approximately 50 nm was obtained by mechanical polishing . 
A further finish was carried out using ion beam milling ( PIPS , Gatan model 691 ) by focusing 3 keV Ar + ions at a glancing angle of 6 ° on the surface of the specimen for a few minutes . 
An Akashi EM - 002B TEM instrument operated at 200 kV was used to carry out microstructural and analytical characterization . 
The microstructure of powder particles exhibited coexisting faceted primary phase of Si and complex intermetallic phases . 
The size of Si particles varied from 3 to 10 lm in contrast to the 20 – 45 lm size of the intermetallics . 
An illustrative example of a set of micrographs recorded from 100 lm powder particles is shown in Fig . 2 . 
The micrographs clearly show the faceted and needle - shaped morphologies of primary Si and intermetallics , respectively . 
Some of the Si particles also show a rosette - like morphology ( Fig . 2 ( b ) ) . 
A clear boundary along the Si and intermetallic particles shows that there is no significant interplay of these phases with the matrix at the interface . 
Moreover , a uniformity of the distribution of Si and intermetallics in the Al matrix is clearly delineated . 
The spray - deposited alloy revealed a considerable refinement in microstructure compared to conventionally cast alloy and oversprayed powder particles . 
The spray - deposited alloy showed primary Si phase 3 – 10 lm in size coexisting with fine plates of intermetallics ( Fig . 3 ( a ) ) . 
The aspect ratio of plates of the intermetallics is much smaller in the spray - deposited alloy than in powder particles . 
These features are in distinct contrast to the microstructure of conventionally cast alloy having 90 – 150 lm cuboids of primary Si phase together with long bright rods of intermetallic phases with a variation in size from 170 to 200 lm ( Fig . 3 ( b ) ) . 
The present study shows that in case of the spray - deposited alloy the intermetallic phases are not needle - like and instead are of rectangular shape . 
It is worth mentioning that in our previous investigation X - ray diffraction data showed that the powder particles contained Al , Si and d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe phases , whereas the spray - deposited alloy contained Al , Si , d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe , b - Al 5 SiFe and h - Al 3 Fe phases [ 29 ] . 
The energy spectra recorded from the spray - deposited alloy using an energy dispersive spectroscopy ( EDS ) instrument equipped with SEM capability gave interesting data ( Fig . 4 ) . 
Fig . 4 ( a ) shows that the matrix of the alloy has a major primary phase of a - Al with the presence of small amounts of Cu , Si and O ( Al – 1 . 21Si – 0 . 47Cu – 8 . 32O ( at . % ) ) . 
The EDS spectrum in Fig . 4 ( b ) reveals that the particulates ( plates ) in gray contrast ( Fig . 3 ( a ) ) contain Si as a major element ( Si – 37 . 18Al – 0 . 14Cu ( at . % ) ) , whereas the EDS spectrum in Fig . 4 ( c ) recorded from the bright plates ( Fig . 3 ( a ) ) consisted of Al , Si and Fe ( Al – 18 . 74Si – 13 . 73Fe ( at . % ) ) . 
The bright plates revealed that the composition Al 4 . 92 SiFe 1 . 3 measured through EDS is close to Al 5 SiFe . 
It was difficult to distinguish between d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe and b - Al 5 SiFe phases due to their identical microstructure . 
In a similar study of the as - cast alloy ( Fig . 3 ( b ) ) , the compositions of matrix phase , needles with bright contrast and fine needles determined using EDS were Al 21 Si 7 . 5 O , Al 3 . 4 Si 2 Fe and Al 8 . 34 Si 1 . 36 Fe , respectively . 
A comparison of the morphology of the phases present in powder particles and spray - deposited alloy shows that the intermetallics are much finer than the primary Si phase . 
This has been attributed basically to the large aspect ratio of intermetallics that adds to the ease of fragmentation under the influence of shear action generated by the high velocity gas jets and turbulent fluid flow conditions due to momentum transfer from droplets to the deposition suface . 
It is interesting to note that the powder particles exhibited only nonequilibrium tetragonal d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe phase , whereas the spray deposited alloy consisted of both d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe and b - Al 5 SiFe . 
The existence of only d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe phase in powder particles is in agreement with a previous report [ 16 ] . 
Nonequilibrium solidification of droplets during melt atomization leads to the formation of d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe phase , whereas the higher temperature and lower cooling rate experienced by the liquid pool during spray deposition lead to the transformation of d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe to b - Al 5 SiFe . 
As the period of high - temperature exposure is short during deposition with a continuous turbulence of atomizing gas on the deposition surface , a complete phase transformation of d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe to b - Al 5 SiFe may not be possible . 
This phenomenon may lead to the coexistence of both the d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe and b - Al 5 SiFe phases in the spray - deposited alloy [ 29 ] . 
Several interesting microstructural features were observed in the hot - extruded alloys . 
The TEM study revealed that the microstructure of the extruded alloy consisted of a fine - grained matrix of the primary a - phase along with Si particles and other intermetallics of different crystal structures . 
The primary a - grains were normally faceted with sharp edges . 
The ultrafine Si and intermetallic phases were observed to decorate the peripheral regions of the primary Al grains as well as the grain boundaries . 
Most of the intermetallic phases were observed to be well within 30 nm in size . 
These features are shown in Fig . 5 ( a ) . 
The Al grains are partitioned with an array of dislocations and the broken pieces of intermetallics together with deformed nanometric Si are distributed in the matrix . 
Fig . 5 ( b ) reveals the presence of a nano - sized Si particle with a sharp notch embedded in the matrix . 
Another interesting microstructural feature of the alloy having two intermetallics of parallelepiped shapes of about 500 nm in length is shown in Fig . 6 . 
It is important to mention that the microstructural investigations were carried out on the transverse sections of the spray - formed and extruded alloy . 
However , some of the specimens were also prepared using the longitudinal sections of the rods after extrusion . 
In addition to the microstructural features observed for transverse sections of the rod , a prominent lamellar structure was also noticed along the longitudinal sections ( Fig . 7 ) . 
The lamellar structure is fine and elongated with an alternate dark and bright contrast . 
A number of intermetallic compounds in Al – Si – Fe - based alloys influence the mechanical properties . 
The thermal state of the deposition surface during spray forming leads to considerable modification in intermetallic compounds such as a - AlFeSi , d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe , b - Al 5 SiFe , a - Al 12 Fe 3 Si and Al 8 Fe 2 Si depending upon the solidification conditions and the composition of the alloy [ 9 , 34 , 36 ] . 
A small amount of Fe ( < 1 % ) provides the required ductility and toughness , but at higher levels rod - like brittle intermet - allics such as a - AlFeSi and b - Al 5 SiFe degrade the mechanical properties of the alloys due to their needle / plate - like morphology that acts as a stress concentrator . 
A summary of the various phases and their morphology formed in Al – Si – Fe alloys is given in Table 1 . 
It has been mentioned [ 11 ] that sometimes solution treatment of the alloys leads to dissolution of b - Al 5 SiFe to give rise to Al and Al 6 Fe . 
The corners of the b - Al 5 SiFe phase dissolve resulting in a reduction in the aspect . ratio . 
This phenomenon in turn leads to better microstructures , hardness and machinability . 
Analytical characterization at the nanoscale with a probe size of 5 . 9 nm has been carried out using a TEM instrument equipped with EDS capability . 
Extensive and precise EDS measurements made it possible to determine the compositions of various intermetallic lamellae and also to estimate the solid solubility of Fe and Si in the Al matrix . 
Table 2 shows a comparison of EDS data collected from different phases present in the spray - formed and extruded alloy . 
It is noticed that the solid solubility of Fe and Si in Al varies to some extent . 
The data reported from the three different regions showed that Si in these regions has higher solubility ( 2 . 24 , 2 . 57 and 1 . 32 at . % ) than Fe ( 0 . 8 , 1 . 22 and 0 . 48 at . % ) . 
It is further noted that when the solubility of Si ( 2 . 57 at . % ) is high , the solubility of Fe ( 1 . 22 at . % ) is also high . 
This shows that there is a similar trend of increasing and decreasing solid solubility of Si and Fe in the Al matrix . 
This observation may be related to the cooling rate of molten alloy , which influences the solubility of Si and Fe in similar solidification conditions in the nanoscale vicinity of a local solid – liquid front at a given time . 
The difference in solid solubility of Si and Fe in Al for different regions of the matrix is attributed to local fluctuation in solidification conditions during the spray deposition process . 
It has been discussed [ 44 ] that the liquid pool may also experience different degrees of undercooling spatially . 
This may also lead to nonequilibrium microstructural features . 
The lamellar structure with an alternate bright and dark contrast appears to have resulted from Al - and Si - rich regions . 
This feature is considered to arise due to the difference in ductility of Al and Si . 
Nanoscaled appearance of the two elements during extrusion , the Al being ductile in comparison to Si elongates more and the adjacent Si takes the shape of Al along the direction of the extrusion . 
However , this behavior is possible only at the places where Si also appears as nanoparticles . 
In the case where the Si is not in the nanoscale , it would deform to have fracture and fragments of smaller sized Si particles . 
An EDS analysis of an intermetallic phase as illustrated in Fig . 6 and Table 2 , leads to the composition of Si ( 13 . 33 at . % ) and Fe ( 17 . 98 at . % ) in Al . 
This composition is close to that of b - Al 5 SiFe . 
The evidence of a cubic a - Al 12 Fe 3 Si phase has also been noticed in the alloy . 
Since the a - AlFeSi phase was present only as a minor constituent in the alloy , its appearance has not been discussed in detail . 
However , it is worth mentioning that in a previous study of a spray - deposited Al – Fe – V – Si alloy [ 34 ] , this phase ( a - Al 12 ( Fe , V ) 3 Si ) was the only intermetallic ( approximately 500 nm in size ) distributed throughout in the a - Al matrix . 
The microstructure of the spray - deposited alloy is a composite with Si and intermetallic particles embedded in a fine - grained Al matrix . 
After having attained a homogeneous composite microstructure , the material underwent a process of hot deformation using extrusion ( ER , 6 : 1 ) at a temperature of 480 ° C . 
During the process , microstructural refinement and restructuring was obvious as evident from micrographs obtained ( Figs . 5 and 6 ) . 
Hot deformation also leads to grain recovery and recrystallization to a certain extent . 
Therefore the final microstructure of the spray - formed and extruded alloy may be explained on the basis of cracking and deformation of large - sized brittle particles and their subsequent realignment around the fine - grained matrix boundaries . 
The Al being a soft and ductile phase can accommodate the broken Si particles and ultra - fine intermetallics around the peripheral regions of the grain boundaries . 
Initially the cracking of Si particles starts due to macroscopic plastic strain during extrusion , and during this process coarse Si particles fragment into finer sizes . 
A group of Si particles of about 20 – 80 nm in size with sharp edges are evident in Fig . 8 ( a ) . 
It is seen in general that some of the Si particles are coarse and they appear to be connected together by grain boundaries . 
The intermetallic particles are finer and homogeneously distributed inside the grains and at the grain boundaries . 
These particles can weaken the grain boundaries but there is no evidence of their spontaneous cracking . 
Fig . 8 ( b ) clearly shows the deformation bands on an Al grain as well as on a coarse Si particle with an array of dislocations distributed throughout . 
There is also evidence of a fine Si particle trapped at the Al grain boundaries with a partial decohesion on one side with the Al ( Fig . 8 ( b ) ) . 
Fig . 9 shows examples of trapping of intermetallics . 
An ultrafine intermetallic of about 70 nm in size is trapped between Al and Si . 
A network of deformation bands is flowing through the Si particles ( Fig . 9 ( a ) ) . 
At higher magnifications it is seen that the ultrafine and hard intermetallic has developed certain contrast on the surface presumably due to stress experi - enced during the hot deformation ( Fig . 9 ( b ) ) . 
However , no interfacial decohesion of intermetallic particles is observed . 
A case study of a hypereutectic Al – Si alloy with a composition ( Al – 17Si – 4 . 5Cu – 0 . 5Mg ) close to that of the present composition ( Al – 18 % Si – 5 % Fe – 1 . 5 % Cu ) has been carried out to understand the spray dynamics and heat flow during the process of spray forming [ 25 ] . 
By employing a heat flow model [ 34 ] , it was noticed that a 20 lm droplet solidifies in a very short distance of 0 . 014 m , a 50 lm drop - let solidifies at 0 . 29 m , a coarse droplet of 120 lm is in a mushy state , containing 61 % solid and 39 % liquid , at a flight distance of 0 . 4 m , whereas a droplet of 150 lm is completely in the liquid state , even at 0 . 4 m [ 25 ] . 
Therefore by taking a flight distance of 0 . 3 m in the present investigation , a mushy state containing a solid and liquid ratio of about 60 % and 40 % , respectively , has always been created on the growing deposit during solidification . 
A hypereutectic Al – Si alloy as studied in present work can be considered as a metal matrix composite by definition that the Si particulates are physically distinguishable and chemically separable from the Al matrix . 
Moreover the alloy produced would definitely have improved properties compared to Al and Si considered separately . 
However , due to hard and nondeformable Si as reinforcement present in the soft and ductile Al matrix , the deformation mechanism of these composites is rather complex and difficult to predict . 
Microstructural features developed during spray atomization and deposition in the present work further underwent a grain refinement process during hot deformation while the material was extruded at 480 ° C . 
A schematic of the microstructure of the spray - deposited and extruded alloy is shown in Fig . 10 . 
It can be understood from the systematic experimental observations discussed in previous sections , that the Si particles are either finer than or comparable in size to the Al grains and are normally connected with the grain boundaries . 
The coarser Si particles are often cracked , whereas the medium - sized and fine Si particles are in good contact with the matrix occasionally showing a partial decohesion characteristic with the matrix . 
The intermetallic phases are normally ultrafine in size and homogeneously distributed inside the grains and at grain boundaries . 
There is no evidence of breaking of intermetallics in the microstructure . 
In general the electron microscopy study of the spray - formed and extruded rods revealed the fine - scale homogeneous distribution of Si particulates in the matrix . 
Such a microstructure leads to several important properties [ 3 , 4 , 37 ] . 
The most important are that the Al alloy with hypereutectic Si concentration would provide excellent wear resistance with a low coefficient of thermal expansion and high modulus . 
Such alloys are in great demand for the automobile and aerospace industries . 
Moreover the ultrafine intermetallics , with their uniform distribution in the matrix , improve tremendously the strength and high - temperature stability of the alloy . 
The oversprayed powder particles of Al – 18Si – 5Fe – 1 . 5Cu alloy contain a dispersion of faceted Si particles coexisting with long needle - shaped intermetallics in the primary a - phase of Al . 
The solidification structure of different sized powder particles shows heterogeneous nucleation occurring from the surface of the droplet and the solid – liquid interface advancing in a diametrically opposite direction . 
The spray - deposited alloy had a fine - grained microstructure with uniform dispersion of ultrafine primary Si and rectangular - shaped plates of intermetallics in the a - Al matrix . 
In contrast , the spray - deposited and extruded alloy had dislocations present inside the Al grains / grain boundaries along with fragmented pieces of Si and intermetallics of a nanoscale size in the matrix . 
The EDS analysis of phases confirmed the formation of d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe phase in the powder particles . 
In contrast , the spray - deposited alloy contained the b - Al 5 SiFe phase in addition to the d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe phase . 
The formation of the b - Al 5 SiFe phase in the spray - deposited alloy is suggested to arise from the phase transformation of d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe during solidification of the deposit . 
Title : Study on the preparation of the SiCp / Al – 20Si – 3Cu functionally graded material using spray deposition 
The SiCp / Al – 20Si – 3Cu functionally gradient material ( FGMs ) was successfully prepared via the spray deposition technique accompanied with an automatic control system . 
The results reveal that the SiCp weight fraction of the as - deposited preform from the top to the bottom ranges almost continuously from 0 % to 30 % . 
The part with the higher SiCp weight fraction exhibits a relatively smaller density than that with the lower SiCp weight fraction . 
However , the microhardness and the porosity increase with the increasing SiCp weight fraction in the as - deposited preform . 
The X - ray diffraction results exhibit that the secondary phases in the regions with the different amount of SiC particles are the same such as Al2Cu and AlCuMg . 
The spray deposition technology is promising to produce a wide range of other FGMs . 
In this study , the modi ﬁ ed Al – 20Si – 3Cu alloy is selected as the matrix since it exhibits good ﬂ ow ability , excellent strength and favourable wear resistance . 
The nominal chemical compositions ( in wt . % ) of the matrix alloy are 20 % Si , 3 . 0 % Cu , 0 . 5 % Mg , 0 . 3 % Mn and balance Al . 
The silicon carbide particles ( a - SiCp ) are used as the reinforcement and the average size of the reinforcing phase is about 7 μ m . 
The aluminum ingots and the other alloying elements are properly cleaned using the abrasive paper to eliminate the surface impurities prior to melting . 
Then the cleaned raw materials are placed in a crucible set in a pit furnace and superheated to 950 ◦ C . The SiCp particles are preheated to 600 ◦ C for 120 min to improve the wettability [ 14 ] . 
As shown in Fig . 1 , the experimental setup is composed of three units , i . e . the spray deposition unit , the conveyance unit of ceramic particles and the automatic control unit . 
The spray deposition part is the relatively conventional equipment , while the other two parts are the novel devices which play an important role in adjusting the output of SiCp to prepare the FGMs . 
Firstly , the pretreated SiCp particles are put into the feeder ( 21 ) and the alloy melt is imported into the crucible ( 11 ) simultaneously . 
The melt ﬂ ows through a graphite tube and is atomized by the inert gas . 
The ceramic particles are then imported to the venturi ( 26 ) through the impeller ( 23 ) driven by the speed motor ( 24 ) in a high pressure gas channel ( 25 ) when the speed motor ( 24 ) goes into operation . 
The high pressure inert gas goes through the ﬂ ow valve ( 27 ) into the venturi and produces negative pressure which can inhale the SiC particles and ﬁ nally generate a solid - gas dual medium in the vent of the venturi . 
The solid - gas dual medium reaches the injection port of the gunjet ( 12 ) and disperses the ceramic particles into ﬁ ne melt droplets ( 13 ) . 
The atomized droplets are deposited onto the substrate ( 15 ) positioned at an appropriate distance from the nozzle . The substrate is ﬁ xed on a lifting system ( 16 ) which can adjust the height so as to ensure that the distance is constant between the ingot surface and the nozzle during the whole spraying process . 
During the process , the rotary encoder ( 31 ) gathers the data of the speed and the working hours of the drive motor ( 32 ) and then converts them to the height information of the preform . 
Finally , these data are sent to the programmable logic controller ( PLC ) ( 33 ) . 
The PLC is connected to a computer ( 34 ) which is used to control the speed of the impeller motor ( 24 ) and thus the adjustment of the SiCp weight in real time is feasible . 
The technical parameters for the spray deposition process are listed in Table 1 . 
The as - deposited preform is sectioned into the discs with 30 mm in thickness along the deposition direction using the electrical discharge cutting machine for microstructural characterization and microhardness testing . 
The weight fraction of the SiC particles is quantitatively assessed by the chemical dissolution method . 
It can be expressed by the ratio of wp to wt , where wt and wp are the weight of the sample and that of the SiC particles respectively . 
The sample is dissolved in the hydrochloric acid until the matrix is completely disappeared , and then the SiC particles are ﬁ ltered from the distilled water , dried and weighed ( wp ) . 
Microstructural characterization is carried out using the metallographic microscopy with the help of optical microscope ( OM ) and the scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) on the polished samples and is aimed to investigate the distribution of the SiC particles and the interfacial integrity between the matrix and the SiC particles . 
The density of the as - deposited composite sample is measured according to the Archimedes principle . 
The density measurement involves weighing the polished cube ( 10 mm × 10 mm × 10 mm ) in air ( wa ) and that immersed in the distilled water ( ww ) . 
The measured density ρ m is calculated by wa ρ H2O / ( wa − ww ) . 
The porosity volume is obtained by 1 − ρ m / ρ t , while ρ m and ρ t are the measured density the theoretical density respectively . 
The samples are weighed using a FA1004 electronic balance with the accuracy of ± 0 . 0001 g . 
Microhardness testing is conducted on the MHV - 2000 digital microhardness tester . 
A pyramidal diamond indenter with a facing angle of 136 ◦ , the indenting load of 4 . 903N and the loading dwell time of 15s are adopted . 
The regions in the metal matrix and away from the porosities and the reinforcing SiC particles are selected for hardness indentation . 
The X - ray diffraction is conducted on a D - 5000 fully automatic X - ray diffractometer using the Cu Ka radiation . 
The X - ray diffraction patterns with the diffraction angle ( 2 θ ) range between 10 ◦ and 90 ◦ are obtained for phase identi ﬁ cation . 
The SiCp / Al – 20Si – 3Cu functionally gradient material is successfully prepared via the spray deposition process . 
As shown in Fig . 2a , the cylindrical preform with 240 mm in diameter and 280 mm in thickness is spray - deposited . 
Its surface is porous and the shrink - age is visible on the top face . 
The porosity can be attributed to the washout effect of the high pressure gas during the process . 
As shown in Fig . 2b , the surface layer of the as - deposited preform is removed by machine tooling and the cylindrical sample with 220 mm in diameter and 250 mm in thickness is obtained . 
The deposition rate is 44 . 56 g / s . 
The results indicate that spray deposition has the feasibility in the preparation of the FGMs . 
In comparison with conventional casting , spray deposition processing is relatively simple ( no stirring in the melt for the uniform dispersion of the particles ) and has the ability in producing large parts . 
For the entire processing , the supply system of the SiC particles is the key factor . 
The automatic control unit is designed to obtain the solid - gas dual medium ﬂ ow of the graded SiC particles . 
At the beginning of the processing , the speed of the impeller is zero and there is no output of the SiC particles . 
Then , the speed of the impeller increases gradually from 0 to 300 rpm , indicating that the output speed of the SiC particles ranges from 0 to 15 g / s . 
The relationship of the conveyance speed of the SiC particles against the motor speed is shown in Fig . 3 . 
The scattered points are experimental data . 
The input weight of the SiC particles exhibits a linear relationship with the impeller speed . 
The line in Fig . 3 is derived as a linear regression from the scattered values . 
All the results indicate that spray deposition is a reliable approach in producing the FGMs . 
The distribution of SiC particles in the as - deposited preform along the longitudinal direction is shown in Fig . 4 . 
The weight fraction of SiC particles in the as - deposited preform increases from the bottom to the top , which can be attributed to the different speed of the impeller controlled by the computer . 
The micrographs of the different regions in the preform are shown in Fig . 5 . 
No macroscopical defects are observed at the bottom where the SiC fraction is low . 
However , as the fraction of SiC particles increases , porosity also increases . 
Layered strips accompanied with pores are observed in the 60 mm regions from the top of the preform . 
The micrographs indicate that the volume fraction of SiC particles decreases gradually from the top to the bottom . 
In addition , the distribution of SiC particles is fairly uniform in each cross - section along the longitudinal direction . 
To further understand the distribution characteristics of SiC particles in the FGM , samples are sectioned from the preform at a distance of 60 and 210 mm from the bottom respectively and their fractured surfaces are also examined by SEM . 
As shown in Fig . 6 , the interface between the SiC particles and the matrix exhibits a good bonding in the area with the uniform distribution of SiC particles . 
As shown in Fig . 6a , no visible microvoids are detected at the interface between the SiC particles and the matrix . 
Most particles are impinged into the droplets , which are chilled during the spray deposition processing . 
The SiC particles are packed by the matrix alloy and no obvious interfacial reaction is observed . 
However , the bridging phenomenon of SiC particles exists , which is indicated by Fig . 6b . 
In addition , the more severe clustering tendency is also observed at the top of the pre - form than the bottom . 
The samples of 40 , 150 and 210 mm away from the bottom are studied . 
As shown in Fig . 7 , the porosity is visible . 
As indicated in Figs . 5 and 7 , the volume of the porosity increases with the increasing distance from the position to the basal body , along with the weight fraction of SiC particles . Moreover , the pores are mostly irregular in shape , which is ascribed to several factors . 
During the spray deposition processing , addition of higher amount of the SiC particles results in the clustering of particles and the entrapping of gas bubbles . 
Both can lead to the bridging of particles and thus liquid aluminum is dif ﬁ cult to ﬁ ll the spaces among them . 
The particles are packed to each other and corners are formed among them . 
Since the wettability between the SiC particles and aluminum is poor , the in ﬁ ltration of the alloy melt into the crevices among the particles is confronted with great dif ﬁ culties . 
Furthermore , the gas remained in the holes that prevent the ﬁ lling of the melt to maintain a steady pressure . 
The above results are in good consistency with those of the other researchers in this ﬁ eld [ 15 , 16 ] . 
Samples with the SiCp fraction of 15 % , 10 % and 5 % respectively are taken from the preform and the XRD analysis is conducted to investigate the phase constitutions of the layers with the different SiC addition . 
As shown in Fig . 8 , Al2Cu and AlCuMg are detected in all the samples . 
As shown in Figs . 5 and 7 , the primary silicon is ﬁ ne , dispersed and particle - like . 
The as - deposited SiCp / Al – 20Si – 3Cu functionally gradient material is composed of the Al matrix , the particle - like primary Si phase , SiC particles and the intermetallics mentioned above . 
The fraction of SiC particles has no obvious in ﬂ uence on the phase constitutions of the FGM and thus the subsequent densi ﬁ cation processing is possible . 
The density and the porosity versus the longitudinal distance from the bottom in the as - deposited Al – 20Si – 3Cu / SiCp FGM are shown in Fig . 9 . 
As seen from Fig . 9 , the density decreases with the increasing distance from the position to the bottom but the porosity increases . 
The latter is related to the increasing weight fraction of SiC particles from the bottom to the top . 
As shown in Fig . 9 , the calculated porosity is consistent with the results of micrographs . 
Although the density of SiC particles is greater than that of the Al – 20Si – 3Cu alloy , it is rational that the section with a higher weight fraction of SiC particles has a relatively lower density owing to the increasing porosity . 
The microhardness versus the longitudinal distance from the bottom in the as - deposited Al – 20Si – 3Cu / SiCp FGM is shown in Fig . 10 . 
Obviously , the matrix in the region with a higher fraction of SiC particles exhibits a higher microhardness value along the deposition direction . 
It is consistent with the fundamental mechanism responsible for strengthening of the metallic matrix by the reinforcing SiC particles . 
The presence of the stronger and stiffer SiC particles leads to the additional constraint to the localized plastic deformation of the matrix during the microhardness testing . Moreover , the considerable difference in the thermal expansion coef ﬁ cient between aluminum alloy and SiC contributes to the higher dislocation density in the matrix and thus brings about the hardening of the matrix . 
It has been reported that the dislocation density in the composite increases with the increasing fraction of the ceramic reinforcing particles [ 15 ] . 
Due to the presence of the porosity , the as - deposited Al – 20Si – 3Cu / SiCp FGM exhibits the inferior mechanical properties , indicating densi ﬁ cation is requisite before it is put into practical applications . 
The detailed investigation on the densi ﬁ cation process and mechanical properties of the Al – 20Si – 3Cu / SiCp FGM is underway . 
The spray deposition technique accompanied with an automatic control system for the adjustment of the output of SiC particles can be successfully used to prepare the bulk Al – 20Si – 3Cu / SiCp functionally gradient material . 
The microstructure of the spray - deposited SiCp / Al – 20Si – 3Cu functionally gradient material is composed of the Al matrix , the particle - like primary Si , SiC particles and the intermetallics such as Al2 Cu and AlCuMg . 
The fraction of SiC particles has no obvious in ﬂ uence on the phase constitutions of the FGM . 
The weight fraction of SiC particles in the as - deposited preform from the top to the bottom ranges almost continuously from 0 % to 30 % and their distribution is fairly uniform in each cross - section along the longitudinal direction . 
The microhardness and the porosity increase with the increasing SiCp weight fraction in the as - deposited preform , while the density is opposite . 
Title : Effect of Cr and Mn on the microstructure of spray - formed Al – 25Si – 5Fe – 3Cu alloy 
The hypereutectic Al – Si – Fe alloys with different Mn and Cr addition were synthesized by spray forming technique , and the microstructural evolutions induced by Mn and Cr have been investigated using ﬁ eld emission scanning electron microscopy ( FE - SEM ) , X - ray diffraction ( XRD ) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) . 
The results show that the modi ﬁ cation effect of co - addition of Mn and Cr is more effective than the individual Mn or Cr addition in transforming harmful rod - like Fe - bearing β phase to particulate α - phase . 
Meanwhile , the modi ﬁ cation effect of Cr is superior to that induced by Mn . 
The Mn / Cr ratio plays an important role in the combined addition . 
The addition of 2 wt % Mn + 1 wt % Cr to spray formed alloy has induced an ideal microstructure with entirely ﬁ ne granular intermetallic compounds dispersed in Al matrix . 
DSC analyses indicate that both Mn and Cr can greatly in ﬂ uence the onset temperatures and the region widths of primary Si , δ phase and α phase , but bring little changes on multi - phase reaction , which would contribute to the modi ﬁ catsion effects of Mn , Cr and Mn + Cr . 
The investigation was performed on six alloys and the Al – 25 wt % Si – 5 wt % Fe – 3 wt % Cu was selected as base alloy ( denoted as SF - B ) , and the others were shown in Table 1 . 
The raw materials included pure Al ( 99 . 7 % purity ) , Al – 40Si ( Si content : 40 % , other impurities ≤ 0 . 5 wt % , Al balanced ) and Al – 50Cu ( Cu content : 50 % other impurities ≤ 0 . 5 wt % , Al balanced ) master alloys , and commercial Fe - ( 75 wt % Fe , the rest is ﬂ ux ) , Mn - ( 75 wt % Mn , the rest is ﬂ ux ) , Cr ( 60 wt % Cr , the rest is ﬂ ux ) additives . 
All binary master alloys and other alloying elements used in the present study were obtained from Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials and Beijing general institute of mining & metallurgy respectively . 
The master alloys and alloying elements were ﬁ rst melted together in an induction melting furnace and superheated to 1153 – 1203 K . 
Then , the superheated melts were atomized into droplets by nitrogen gas and the droplets were deposited on a rotating substrate to form a three dimensional preform . 
The details of the spray forming process can be found in Ref . 
[ 25 ] . 
All the specimens were cut from the center part of the sprayformed alloys . 
The microstructure was studied by means of FE - SEM , XRD , TEM , and DSC . 
Specimens for all FE - SEM ( ZEISS SUPRA55 equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy ( EDS ) ) observations were prepared by the standard metallographic procedures using SiC abrasive paper , 2 . 5 μ m diamond polishing paste and Keller ’ s reagent . 
The thin foils for TEM studies were mechanically polished ﬁ rstly and ﬁ nally ion milled in a dual ion - beam miller at a current of 0 . 5 mA , and the thin foils were examined in a HITACHI H - 800 TEM ( equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy , EDS ) operated at 200 kV . 
X - ray diffraction ( XRD ) analyses were carried out with Philips APD - 10 diffractometer using Cu K α radiation ( 40 kV / 150 mA ) . 
The DSC experiments were performed on a NETZSCH STA 409C / CD DSC instrument at the cooling rate of 10 K / min . The weight of each specimen for DSC analysis was 5 – 6 mg . 
Thearea fraction of rod - like and block - like phases was analyzed by ImageTools 1 . 0 software . 
The microstructure of SF - B alloy can be described as consisting of white rod / needle - like phase and bright white phase besides Al matrix and grey Si particles as shown in Fig . 1 ( a ) . 
The area fraction of these rod - like phases is about 10 ± 0 . 3 % as listed in Table 2 . The XRD result [ Fig . 1 ( b ) ] identi ﬁ es the presence of β - Al5FeSi , δ - Al4FeSi2 and Al2Cu phases in the alloy . 
For the white short - rod like particle , the EDS analysis ( Table 3 ) has disclosed a composition of Al4 . 72 FeSi1 . 14 or Al3 . 32 FeSi2 . 4 that is close to β - Al5FeSi or δ - Al4FeSi2 respectively . 
Taking into account the results of the XRD and EDS analyses , it can be deduced that the white short - rod phase might be ␤ - Al5 FeSi / δ - Al4FeSi2 . 
However , it is dif ﬁ cult to de ﬁ nitely differentiate these two Fe - bearing phases each other for the extreme similarity on their sizes and morphologies . 
The coupled results of EDS and XRD analyses also con ﬁ rm the bright white phase to be Al2Cu . 
Fig . 2 ( a ) presents the typical SEM micrograph of SF - M2 alloy consisting of Al matrix , grey Si particles ( pointed out by arrow A ) , rod / needle - like ( pointed out by arrow B ) , blocky ( pointed out by arrow C ) and granular ( pointed out by arrow D ) white intermetallic compounds . 
The rod - like intermetallics has a size in length ranging from 30 to 45 μ m with an aspect ratio ≥ 4 , the blocky intermetallics were about 4 – 8 μ m , and the ﬁ ne granular intermetallics is less than 3 μ m . 
The total area fraction of such rod - like and blocky intermetallics is about 8 . 52 ± 0 . 06 % . 
From the insert in Fig . 2 ( a ) some bright white granular intermetallics ( pointed out by arrow E ) can also be seen . 
Coupled EDS results with XRD analysis , it can be determined that the white rod - / needle - like intermetallic compounds is β - Al5 ( Fe , Mn ) Si phase , the white granular particles are α - Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 phase and the bright white phase was Al2Cu phase . 
The δ - Al4 FeSi2 phase is not detected by XRD analysis , as shown in Fig . 2 ( b ) . 
Fig . 3 shows the SEM micrograph and the XRD pattern of SF - C2 alloy . 
The SF - C2 alloy is also consisted of Al matrix , grey Si particles ( arrow A ) , white rod - like ( arrow B ) , and blocky ( arrow C ) or granular ( arrow D and arrow E ) intermetallics . 
The rod - like compounds are estimated to be about 20 μ m in length accompanied by an aspect ratio of less than 3 , the blocky particle is about 10 – 20 μ m , and the size of those ﬁ ne granular particles is the same as those in SF - M2 alloy . 
According to XRD and EDS results , both rod - like and blocky intermetallics are identi ﬁ ed to be β - Al5 ( Fe , Cr ) Si , and the white granular compound and the bright white intermetallics are α - Al15 ( Fe , Cr ) 3Si2 and Al2Cu , respectively . 
The total area fraction of rod - like and blocky β - Al5 ( Fe , Cr ) Si is about 4 . 22 ± 0 . 05 % , which is much smaller than that in SF - M2 alloy . 
Obviously , the addition of Cr to the spray formed Al – 25Si – 5Fe – 3Cu alloy leads to a marked decrease of β phase and the appearance of blocky β - Al5 ( Fe , Cr ) Si with a large size and a small aspect ratio . 
The typical SEM image and corresponding XRD pattern of SFMC11 alloy are shown in Fig . 4 . 
One can see that the rod - like ( arrow B ) , blocky ( arrow C ) and granular ( arrow D , arrow E ) intermetallic compounds are present accompanied by primary Si ( arrow A ) and Al matrix . 
The long rod - like particle has a length less than 25 μ m with an aspect ratio of 4 – 8 . 
The blocky particle has a size less than 10 μ m . 
The granular intermetallic particle is less than 3 μ m . 
According to of the XRD and EDS analyses , both the rodlike and blocky phases are β - Al5 ( Fe , Mn , Cr ) Si , while the granular phases are α - Al15 ( Fe , Mn , Cr ) 3Si2 and Al2Cu , respectively . 
Evidently , the co - addition of Mn and Cr is helpful to reduce the sizes of blocky particles . 
The area fraction of both rod - like and blocky intermetallic particles is about 7 . 99 ± 0 . 13 % , which is less than that in the SF - M2 alloy but a little more than that in the SF - C2 alloy . 
Compared with the SF - M2 and SF - C2 alloys , the SF - MC11 alloy is more hopeful to further re ﬁ ne during post process such as hot extrusion . 
Further increasing Mn / Cr content in spray formed alloys with co - addition of Mn and Cr will hardly change the microstructural constituents , but obviously change the microstructural features as revealed in Fig . 5 ( SF - MC12 alloy ) and Fig . 6 ( SF - MC21 alloy ) . 
From Fig . 5 , it can be found that the large blocky and coarse rod - like white intermetallics found in Fig . 1 ∼ Fig . 4 is replaced by very few ﬁ ne needle - like and small blocky intermetallic compounds . 
The ﬁ ne needle - like intermetallics range from 10 to 20 μ m with an aspect ratio ≥ 3 , and the size of the small blocky compounds is less than 7 μ m . 
The total area fraction of such ﬁ ne needle - like and small blocky intermetallics is about 5 ± 0 . 05 % . 
Detailed studies on microstructural feature of SF - MC21 alloy had been performed in early published work [ 25 ] , so , it is not necessary to repeat those results . 
Compared with other alloys , the SF - MC21 alloy has the lowest area fraction of 2 . 0 ± 0 . 06 % for both rod - like and blocky particles as shown in Fig . 6 . 
If β - type phase is only those rod - like and blocky particles , the content of β phase in Fig . 6 is too low to be detected by the XRD method due to its resolving limit . 
Considering both the XRD and SEM results coupled with the resolving ability of XRD method , one can conclude that the actual content of Fe - bearing β phase in the SF - MC21 alloy should be larger than that found in SEM graph . 
That is to say , some of the β phase particles must have a granular shape . 
If it is true , the combination of co - addition of Mn and Cr with spray forming technique could also change the morphology of β - phase from harmful rodlike shape to less harmful granular shape . 
Thus the harmful effect induced by rod - like or needle - like β - phase can be reduced or eliminated . 
Then it is not necessary to completely transform harmful rod - like or needle - like Fe - bearing β phase to harmless compact α - phase by adding large content of Mn or Cr , which will bring the risk of sludge formation in the melt [ 26 ] . 
However , further investigations about the effect of Mn + Cr addition coupled with SF process on β phase morphology need to be conducted in detail . 
On the other hand , the XRD results of SF - MC21 and SF - MC12 alloys also indicate that the co - addition of 3 % ( Mn + Cr ) to spray - formed alloys is still not enough to entirely transform Fe - containing β intermetallics to ﬁ ne granular α - type intermetallics , which is consistent with our earlier research [ 19 ] in which an ideal modi ﬁ ed microstructure could be achieved only on the condition that the value of the Mn / Fe ( wt % ) ratio is about 1 . 0 . 
Apart from the round intermetallics reported in Ref . 
[ 25 ] , the polygonal intermetallics are also present in the alloys with coaddition of Mn and Cr , as shown in Fig . 7 . 
The size of the small polygonal intermetallic particle is about 3 – 5 μ m , which is consistent with those of intermetallics shown in the inserts of SEM images . 
EDS analysis also shows that the polygonal intermetallic phases contained elements of Al , Si , Fe , Mn and Cr . 
The abilities of Mn , Cr and Mn + Cr in modifying harmful Febearing phase can be explained based on the cooling circle DSC analyses . 
The DSC patterns of SF - B , SF - C2 , SF - M2 , SF - MC12 and SFMC21 alloys are shown in Figs . 8 and 9 , respectively . 
The peaks in DSC traces and possible phase transformations during the cooling were listed in Table 4 . 
As shown in Fig . 8 , four exothermic peaks appeared in the DSC trace of SF - B alloy . 
Three small exotherms with onset temperature of 1076 K , 997 K and 789 K may correspond to crystallization of primary Si , δ - Al4FeSi2 , and quaternary eutectic , respectively , and the sharp exothermic peak with an onset temperature of 831 K may correspond to a ternary eutectic solidi ﬁ cation , which is in agreement with the ternary Al – Fe – Si phase diagram [ 29 ] . 
The solidi ﬁ cation sequence of the SF - B alloy can been described as follows : the primary Si is formed ﬁ rstly ( peak 1 ) , followed by precipitating the non - equilibrium δ - Al4FeSi2 ( peak 2 ) . During cooling between peak2 and peak4 , the δ - Al4FeSi2 phase is transformed to β - Al5FeSi phase . 
When the temperature reaches peak4 , the eutectic reaction L → Al + Si + Al5FeSi will take place . Finally , the remaining liquid solidify into quaternary eutectic of Al + Si + θ - Al2Cu + Al5FeSi corresponding to peak 5 region . 
Thermo gram ’ s shape is in ﬂ uenced by the Mn or Cr addition in the examined alloys . 
When 2 wt % Mn or 2 wt % Cr is added to SF - B alloy , not only a new reaction ( peak 3 ) corresponding to the crystallization of α - Al15 ( Fe , TM ) 3Si2 is introduced into the DSC traces , but the onset temperatures of the thermal reactions are changed as well . 
The four small exothermic peaks marked as 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 ware corresponding to the crystallization of primary Si , δ - Al4 ( Fe , TM ) Si2 , α - Al15 ( Fe , TM ) 3Si2 and quaternary eutectic , respectively , and the sharp exothermic peak denoted as 4 is corresponding to a ternary eutectic solidi ﬁ cation . 
According to the literatures [ 19 , 25 , 28 ] , the solidi ﬁ cation sequence of the spray formed alloys with the addition of Mn or Cr can be described as follows : primary Si is formed ﬁ rstly ( peak 1 ) , followed by precipitation of non - equilibrium δ - Al4 ( Fe , TM ) Si2 ( peak 2 ) . 
During cooling between peak2 and peak3 , the formed δ - Al4 ( Fe , TM ) Si2 phase transforms to β - Al5 ( Fe , TM ) Si . When the temperature reaches peak3 , the β - Al5 ( Fe , TM ) Si and the residual δ - Al4 ( Fe , TM ) Si2 phase will react peritectically with liquid to form α - Al15 ( Fe , TM ) 3Si2 phase . 
After that , a ternary eutectic consisting of α - Al , Si , and α - Al15 ( Fe , TM ) 3 Si2 will form at peak 4 region . Finally , the remaining liquid solidify into quaternary eutectic of Al + Si + θ - Al2Cu + Al15 ( Fe , TM ) 3 Si2 at peak 5 region . 
Compared with SF - B alloy , the addition of Mn or Cr causes a little change of the starting temperature of peaks 4 and 5 , but a marked change of peaks 1 and 2 . 
Both Mn and Cr addition can greatly decrease the onset precipitation temperature of primary Si phase and increase the onset temperature of peak 2 . 
The addition of Cr is more effective in decreasing the onset temperature of peak 1 but less effective in increasing the starting temperature of peak 2 than Mn . 
The addition of Mn or Cr can also broaden peak 1 but narrow peak 2 . 
From Table 4 , one can ﬁ nd that , in the SF - C2 alloy , peak 3 has a much lower starting temperature than its counterpart in the SF - M2 alloy , and overlaps with the sharp peak 4 , corresponding to a ternary eutectic reaction . 
Thus , it can be considered that the low onset temperature and narrow temperature range of peak 2 are favorable to the formation of ﬁ ne δ phase and the complete transformation of δ phase to β phase . 
The low onset temperature of peak 3 can ease the transformation of β phase to α phase . 
Accordingly , lower content of ␤ phase will be retained in the SF - C2 alloy . In addition , phase transformation from β phase to α - phase could be occurred with eutectic solidi ﬁ cation process of the melt because of the overlapping of peak 3 and peak 4 , as shown in Fig . 8 . 
As such , more β phase can be transformed to α - phase in the SF - C2 alloy . 
As a result , lower content of β phase is left in the SF - C2 alloy than that in the SF - M2 alloy . 
Compared with the SF - M2 alloy , the addition of Cr to SF - M2 alloy causes the further decrease of the starting temperature of primary Si and the further narrowing of the width of peak 2 in SF - MC21 alloy as shown in Fig . 9 . 
Contrarily , the starting temperature of α - phase is further increased , accompanying by expansion of α - phase region . The same changes also happen in the SF - MC12 alloy when Mn was added to SF - C2 alloy . 
The high onset temperature and expanded region of peak 3 are more favorable to the long distance diffusion of Mn , Cr , Fe and Si atoms in Al melts and pre - solidi ﬁ ed phases such as β - phase . 
And thus a complete transformation from ﬁ ne β - phase to α - phase can take place , and more α - phase can be formed in the exterior of the coarse β - particle . 
With the exfoliation of α - phase formed at the periphery of the coarse β - phase during spray forming process , the coarse β - phase particles will gradually decrease and re ﬁ ne . 
Obviously , the ﬁ ne β - phase particle can be easily fragmentized to particulates by impingement and shear force of turbulent ﬂ uid during spray forming process [ 17 ] . 
Considering above analysis , more addition of Mn or Cr can cause a better microstructure in the SF alloys . 
Compared the SF - MC21 alloy with the SF - MC12 alloy , one can ﬁ nd that the modi ﬁ cation effect induced by 2 wt % Mn + 1 wt % Cr co - addition is superior to that induced by 1 wt % Mn + 2 wt % Cr coaddition , which implies that the Mn / Cr ratio play an important role in the microstructural modi ﬁ cation . 
This can be also explained by their DSC patterns . 
As mentioned above , Mn was more effective in increasing both precipitation temperatures of β - and α - phase than Cr . 
The onset temperature of α - phase in the SF - MC21 alloy is much higher than that in the SF - MC12 alloy , but the width of α - phase regions in both alloys is nearly equal . 
Therefore , the transformation of β to α - phase may depend more on the starting precipitation temperature of α - phase than on the width of α - phase region . 
In a thermal activating process , a higher temperature is always more favorable to the diffusion of alloying elements , especially to the diffusion of those elements with low diffusion coef ﬁ cient . 
Meanwhile , transformation of β - phase to α - phase could be occurred more easily and completely . 
That is why an ideal microstructure could be achieved easily in the SF - MC21 alloy . 
Both the addition of Mn or Cr can modify the characteristics of the intermetallics in the spray - formed alloys through changing the phase precipitation region . 
In the case of single addition , Cr is more effective in decreasing the content of harmful rod - like β - phase than Mn . 
With the same total content of alloying elements , the composite modi ﬁ cation effect caused by co - addition of Mn and Cr is superior to that induced by individual addition of Mn or Cr . 
With the increase of the content of Mn + Cr , the onset temperature of the precipitation of α - phase increases accompanied by the broadening of the α - phase precipitation temperature range , and the volume fraction and size of rod - like β - phase are also reduced gradually . 
Mn / Cr ratio plays an important role in optimizing microstructure on the condition that Mn and Cr co - exist in the SF alloys . 
The co - addition of 2 wt % Mn + 1 wt % Cr has produced an ideal microstructure with entirely ﬁ ne granular intermetallic compounds in the studied alloys . 
Meanwhile , the morphology of such Fe - rich β phase can also be changed from traditional rod - like shape to granular one by the co - addition of Mn and Cr , coupled with the spray forming technique . 
The details of this change need further investigation . 
Title : Microstructural features induced by spray processing and hot extrusion of an Al – 18 % Si – 5 % Fe – 1 . 5 % Cu alloy 
An inert gas atomization technique was employed to produce spray deposits of an Al – 18Si – 5Fe – 1 . 5Cu ( wt . % ) alloy . 
The spray - deposited alloy was subsequently hot extruded with a reduction ratio of 6 : 1 and extrusion temperature of 480 ° C . 
The microstructural features of the as - spray - deposited and extruded alloys were examined using optical , scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy techniques , and chemical analyses of phases were carried out using energy dispersive X - ray analysis and spectroscopic methods . 
The microstructure of the spray - deposited alloy revealed the presence of a cellular and plate - like morphology of b - Al 5 SiFe phase coexisting with d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe phase in contrast to the presence of only d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe phase in atomized powder particles . 
The formation of the b - Al 5 SiFe phase is suggested to arise as a result of phase transformation of d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe phase during slow cooling of the spray deposit . 
The hot extrusion of the alloy resulted in fragmentation of both intermetallic phases and Si into nano - sized particles . 
The microstructure evolution during spray deposition and hot extrusion of the alloy is discussed . 
Alloy corresponding to the nominal composition Al – 18Si – 5Fe – 1 . 5Cu ( wt . % ) was prepared by melting 4 N purity Al with high - purity Si , Fe and Cu in a graphite - bonded fireclay crucible . 
A schematic of the spray atomization and deposition process is shown in Fig . 1 . 
The details of the spray - forming setup have been discussed elsewhere [ 29 , 34 ] . 
In brief , the experimental setup consisted of a nozzle assembly , an atomization chamber and a control system to maneuver the movement of the deposition substrate . 
The atomization of the melt was carried out using an annular confined gas atomization nozzle centered around a melt flow tube [ 34 ] . 
A resistance - heating furnace was used for preheating the tundish to avoid premature freezing of the melt . 
The alloy was melted in a graphite crucible and the melt was superheated to 975 ° C in a resistance - heating furnace prior to its atomization . 
The melt temperature was recorded using a chromel – alumel thermocouple with an accuracy in temperature control to within ± 2 ° C . 
The atomization chamber was purged with N 2 gas before the melt was poured into the tundish of the atomization assembly preheated to a temperature of 200 ° C . 
Gas flow was subsequently initiated to promote atomization of the melt . 
The spray was allowed to deposit over a cast iron substrate to achieve a coherent and dense alloy preform . 
The amount deposited in each run was about 1 . 2 kg . 
The oversprayed powder particles were collected from the atomization chamber and cyclone collector . 
Cylindrical samples of 25 mm in diameter and 50 mm in length were machined out from each spray deposit obtained . 
Subsequently , hot extrusion of the as - deposited alloys was carried out using an extrusion ratio ( ER ) of 6 : 1 ( area reduction ) at a temperature of 480 ° C . 
The chemical composition of the spray - formed alloy was analyzed using the X - ray fluorescence technique ( SRS3400 , Bruecker , Germany ) . 
The alloy was found to contain 17 . 890 % Si , 5 . 190 % Fe , 1 . 632 % Cu , 0 . 007 % Cr , 0 . 004 % Mn , 0 . 012 % Mg , and the balance Al . 
This is very close to the nominal composition of the alloy . 
Several samples were machined from the center and peripheral regions of the as - deposited and hot - extruded alloys for microstructural examination . 
The samples were polished following standard metallographic procedures and etched with Keller ’ s reagent ( 95 % H 2 O – 2 . 5 % HNO 3 – 1 . 5 % HCl – 1 % HF , by volume ) . 
The microstructure of the samples was examined using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ; JEOL JSM 840 , 20 kV ) and optical microscopy ( Leitz instrument ) . 
Samples for transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) study of spray - deposited and extruded alloy were prepared from a thin slice of about 50 lm glued on a tripod for mechanical polishing [ 48 ] . 
The mechanical polishing was performed using successive grinding with diamond plastic films of different roughness ( 15 , 6 , 3 , 1 , 0 . 5 lm grains ) and syton , a solution of colloidal silica with 20 nm grains , on a rotating polisher kept under water . 
A specimen thickness of approximately 50 nm was obtained by mechanical polishing . 
A further finish was carried out using ion beam milling ( PIPS , Gatan model 691 ) by focusing 3 keV Ar + ions at a glancing angle of 6 ° on the surface of the specimen for a few minutes . 
An Akashi EM - 002B TEM instrument operated at 200 kV was used to carry out microstructural and analytical characterization . 
The microstructure of powder particles exhibited coexisting faceted primary phase of Si and complex intermetallic phases . 
The size of Si particles varied from 3 to 10 lm in contrast to the 20 – 45 lm size of the intermetallics . 
An illustrative example of a set of micrographs recorded from 100 lm powder particles is shown in Fig . 2 . 
The micrographs clearly show the faceted and needle - shaped morphologies of primary Si and intermetallics , respectively . 
Some of the Si particles also show a rosette - like morphology ( Fig . 2 ( b ) ) . 
A clear boundary along the Si and intermetallic particles shows that there is no significant interplay of these phases with the matrix at the interface . 
Moreover , a uniformity of the distribution of Si and intermetallics in the Al matrix is clearly delineated . 
The spray - deposited alloy revealed a considerable refinement in microstructure compared to conventionally cast alloy and oversprayed powder particles . 
The spray - deposited alloy showed primary Si phase 3 – 10 lm in size coexisting with fine plates of intermetallics ( Fig . 3 ( a ) ) . 
The aspect ratio of plates of the intermetallics is much smaller in the spray - deposited alloy than in powder particles . 
These features are in distinct contrast to the microstructure of conventionally cast alloy having 90 – 150 lm cuboids of primary Si phase together with long bright rods of intermetallic phases with a variation in size from 170 to 200 lm ( Fig . 3 ( b ) ) . 
The present study shows that in case of the spray - deposited alloy the intermetallic phases are not needle - like and instead are of rectangular shape . 
It is worth mentioning that in our previous investigation X - ray diffraction data showed that the powder particles contained Al , Si and d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe phases , whereas the spray - deposited alloy contained Al , Si , d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe , b - Al 5 SiFe and h - Al 3 Fe phases [ 29 ] . 
The energy spectra recorded from the spray - deposited alloy using an energy dispersive spectroscopy ( EDS ) instrument equipped with SEM capability gave interesting data ( Fig . 4 ) . 
Fig . 4 ( a ) shows that the matrix of the alloy has a major primary phase of a - Al with the presence of small amounts of Cu , Si and O ( Al – 1 . 21Si – 0 . 47Cu – 8 . 32O ( at . % ) ) . 
The EDS spectrum in Fig . 4 ( b ) reveals that the particulates ( plates ) in gray contrast ( Fig . 3 ( a ) ) contain Si as a major element ( Si – 37 . 18Al – 0 . 14Cu ( at . % ) ) , whereas the EDS spectrum in Fig . 4 ( c ) recorded from the bright plates ( Fig . 3 ( a ) ) consisted of Al , Si and Fe ( Al – 18 . 74Si – 13 . 73Fe ( at . % ) ) . 
The bright plates revealed that the composition Al 4 . 92 SiFe 1 . 3 measured through EDS is close to Al 5 SiFe . 
It was difficult to distinguish between d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe and b - Al 5 SiFe phases due to their identical microstructure . 
In a similar study of the as - cast alloy ( Fig . 3 ( b ) ) , the compositions of matrix phase , needles with bright contrast and fine needles determined using EDS were Al 21 Si 7 . 5 O , Al 3 . 4 Si 2 Fe and Al 8 . 34 Si 1 . 36 Fe , respectively . 
A comparison of the morphology of the phases present in powder particles and spray - deposited alloy shows that the intermetallics are much finer than the primary Si phase . 
This has been attributed basically to the large aspect ratio of intermetallics that adds to the ease of fragmentation under the influence of shear action generated by the high velocity gas jets and turbulent fluid flow conditions due to momentum transfer from droplets to the deposition suface . 
It is interesting to note that the powder particles exhibited only nonequilibrium tetragonal d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe phase , whereas the spray deposited alloy consisted of both d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe and b - Al 5 SiFe . 
The existence of only d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe phase in powder particles is in agreement with a previous report [ 16 ] . 
Nonequilibrium solidification of droplets during melt atomization leads to the formation of d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe phase , whereas the higher temperature and lower cooling rate experienced by the liquid pool during spray deposition lead to the transformation of d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe to b - Al 5 SiFe . 
As the period of high - temperature exposure is short during deposition with a continuous turbulence of atomizing gas on the deposition surface , a complete phase transformation of d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe to b - Al 5 SiFe may not be possible . 
This phenomenon may lead to the coexistence of both the d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe and b - Al 5 SiFe phases in the spray - deposited alloy [ 29 ] . 
Several interesting microstructural features were observed in the hot - extruded alloys . 
The TEM study revealed that the microstructure of the extruded alloy consisted of a fine - grained matrix of the primary a - phase along with Si particles and other intermetallics of different crystal structures . 
The primary a - grains were normally faceted with sharp edges . 
The ultrafine Si and intermetallic phases were observed to decorate the peripheral regions of the primary Al grains as well as the grain boundaries . 
Most of the intermetallic phases were observed to be well within 30 nm in size . 
These features are shown in Fig . 5 ( a ) . 
The Al grains are partitioned with an array of dislocations and the broken pieces of intermetallics together with deformed nanometric Si are distributed in the matrix . 
Fig . 5 ( b ) reveals the presence of a nano - sized Si particle with a sharp notch embedded in the matrix . 
Another interesting microstructural feature of the alloy having two intermetallics of parallelepiped shapes of about 500 nm in length is shown in Fig . 6 . 
It is important to mention that the microstructural investigations were carried out on the transverse sections of the spray - formed and extruded alloy . 
However , some of the specimens were also prepared using the longitudinal sections of the rods after extrusion . 
In addition to the microstructural features observed for transverse sections of the rod , a prominent lamellar structure was also noticed along the longitudinal sections ( Fig . 7 ) . 
The lamellar structure is fine and elongated with an alternate dark and bright contrast . 
A number of intermetallic compounds in Al – Si – Fe - based alloys influence the mechanical properties . 
The thermal state of the deposition surface during spray forming leads to considerable modification in intermetallic compounds such as a - AlFeSi , d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe , b - Al 5 SiFe , a - Al 12 Fe 3 Si and Al 8 Fe 2 Si depending upon the solidification conditions and the composition of the alloy [ 9 , 34 , 36 ] . 
A small amount of Fe ( < 1 % ) provides the required ductility and toughness , but at higher levels rod - like brittle intermet - allics such as a - AlFeSi and b - Al 5 SiFe degrade the mechanical properties of the alloys due to their needle / plate - like morphology that acts as a stress concentrator . 
A summary of the various phases and their morphology formed in Al – Si – Fe alloys is given in Table 1 . 
It has been mentioned [ 11 ] that sometimes solution treatment of the alloys leads to dissolution of b - Al 5 SiFe to give rise to Al and Al 6 Fe . 
The corners of the b - Al 5 SiFe phase dissolve resulting in a reduction in the aspect . ratio . 
This phenomenon in turn leads to better microstructures , hardness and machinability . 
Analytical characterization at the nanoscale with a probe size of 5 . 9 nm has been carried out using a TEM instrument equipped with EDS capability . 
Extensive and precise EDS measurements made it possible to determine the compositions of various intermetallic lamellae and also to estimate the solid solubility of Fe and Si in the Al matrix . 
Table 2 shows a comparison of EDS data collected from different phases present in the spray - formed and extruded alloy . 
It is noticed that the solid solubility of Fe and Si in Al varies to some extent . 
The data reported from the three different regions showed that Si in these regions has higher solubility ( 2 . 24 , 2 . 57 and 1 . 32 at . % ) than Fe ( 0 . 8 , 1 . 22 and 0 . 48 at . % ) . 
It is further noted that when the solubility of Si ( 2 . 57 at . % ) is high , the solubility of Fe ( 1 . 22 at . % ) is also high . 
This shows that there is a similar trend of increasing and decreasing solid solubility of Si and Fe in the Al matrix . 
This observation may be related to the cooling rate of molten alloy , which influences the solubility of Si and Fe in similar solidification conditions in the nanoscale vicinity of a local solid – liquid front at a given time . 
The difference in solid solubility of Si and Fe in Al for different regions of the matrix is attributed to local fluctuation in solidification conditions during the spray deposition process . 
It has been discussed [ 44 ] that the liquid pool may also experience different degrees of undercooling spatially . 
This may also lead to nonequilibrium microstructural features . 
The lamellar structure with an alternate bright and dark contrast appears to have resulted from Al - and Si - rich regions . 
This feature is considered to arise due to the difference in ductility of Al and Si . 
Nanoscaled appearance of the two elements during extrusion , the Al being ductile in comparison to Si elongates more and the adjacent Si takes the shape of Al along the direction of the extrusion . 
However , this behavior is possible only at the places where Si also appears as nanoparticles . 
In the case where the Si is not in the nanoscale , it would deform to have fracture and fragments of smaller sized Si particles . 
An EDS analysis of an intermetallic phase as illustrated in Fig . 6 and Table 2 , leads to the composition of Si ( 13 . 33 at . % ) and Fe ( 17 . 98 at . % ) in Al . 
This composition is close to that of b - Al 5 SiFe . 
The evidence of a cubic a - Al 12 Fe 3 Si phase has also been noticed in the alloy . 
Since the a - AlFeSi phase was present only as a minor constituent in the alloy , its appearance has not been discussed in detail . 
However , it is worth mentioning that in a previous study of a spray - deposited Al – Fe – V – Si alloy [ 34 ] , this phase ( a - Al 12 ( Fe , V ) 3 Si ) was the only intermetallic ( approximately 500 nm in size ) distributed throughout in the a - Al matrix . 
The microstructure of the spray - deposited alloy is a composite with Si and intermetallic particles embedded in a fine - grained Al matrix . 
After having attained a homogeneous composite microstructure , the material underwent a process of hot deformation using extrusion ( ER , 6 : 1 ) at a temperature of 480 ° C . 
During the process , microstructural refinement and restructuring was obvious as evident from micrographs obtained ( Figs . 5 and 6 ) . 
Hot deformation also leads to grain recovery and recrystallization to a certain extent . 
Therefore the final microstructure of the spray - formed and extruded alloy may be explained on the basis of cracking and deformation of large - sized brittle particles and their subsequent realignment around the fine - grained matrix boundaries . 
The Al being a soft and ductile phase can accommodate the broken Si particles and ultra - fine intermetallics around the peripheral regions of the grain boundaries . 
Initially the cracking of Si particles starts due to macroscopic plastic strain during extrusion , and during this process coarse Si particles fragment into finer sizes . 
A group of Si particles of about 20 – 80 nm in size with sharp edges are evident in Fig . 8 ( a ) . 
It is seen in general that some of the Si particles are coarse and they appear to be connected together by grain boundaries . 
The intermetallic particles are finer and homogeneously distributed inside the grains and at the grain boundaries . 
These particles can weaken the grain boundaries but there is no evidence of their spontaneous cracking . 
Fig . 8 ( b ) clearly shows the deformation bands on an Al grain as well as on a coarse Si particle with an array of dislocations distributed throughout . 
There is also evidence of a fine Si particle trapped at the Al grain boundaries with a partial decohesion on one side with the Al ( Fig . 8 ( b ) ) . 
Fig . 9 shows examples of trapping of intermetallics . 
An ultrafine intermetallic of about 70 nm in size is trapped between Al and Si . 
A network of deformation bands is flowing through the Si particles ( Fig . 9 ( a ) ) . 
At higher magnifications it is seen that the ultrafine and hard intermetallic has developed certain contrast on the surface presumably due to stress experi - enced during the hot deformation ( Fig . 9 ( b ) ) . 
However , no interfacial decohesion of intermetallic particles is observed . 
A case study of a hypereutectic Al – Si alloy with a composition ( Al – 17Si – 4 . 5Cu – 0 . 5Mg ) close to that of the present composition ( Al – 18 % Si – 5 % Fe – 1 . 5 % Cu ) has been carried out to understand the spray dynamics and heat flow during the process of spray forming [ 25 ] . 
By employing a heat flow model [ 34 ] , it was noticed that a 20 lm droplet solidifies in a very short distance of 0 . 014 m , a 50 lm drop - let solidifies at 0 . 29 m , a coarse droplet of 120 lm is in a mushy state , containing 61 % solid and 39 % liquid , at a flight distance of 0 . 4 m , whereas a droplet of 150 lm is completely in the liquid state , even at 0 . 4 m [ 25 ] . 
Therefore by taking a flight distance of 0 . 3 m in the present investigation , a mushy state containing a solid and liquid ratio of about 60 % and 40 % , respectively , has always been created on the growing deposit during solidification . 
A hypereutectic Al – Si alloy as studied in present work can be considered as a metal matrix composite by definition that the Si particulates are physically distinguishable and chemically separable from the Al matrix . 
Moreover the alloy produced would definitely have improved properties compared to Al and Si considered separately . 
However , due to hard and nondeformable Si as reinforcement present in the soft and ductile Al matrix , the deformation mechanism of these composites is rather complex and difficult to predict . 
Microstructural features developed during spray atomization and deposition in the present work further underwent a grain refinement process during hot deformation while the material was extruded at 480 ° C . 
A schematic of the microstructure of the spray - deposited and extruded alloy is shown in Fig . 10 . 
It can be understood from the systematic experimental observations discussed in previous sections , that the Si particles are either finer than or comparable in size to the Al grains and are normally connected with the grain boundaries . 
The coarser Si particles are often cracked , whereas the medium - sized and fine Si particles are in good contact with the matrix occasionally showing a partial decohesion characteristic with the matrix . 
The intermetallic phases are normally ultrafine in size and homogeneously distributed inside the grains and at grain boundaries . 
There is no evidence of breaking of intermetallics in the microstructure . 
In general the electron microscopy study of the spray - formed and extruded rods revealed the fine - scale homogeneous distribution of Si particulates in the matrix . 
Such a microstructure leads to several important properties [ 3 , 4 , 37 ] . 
The most important are that the Al alloy with hypereutectic Si concentration would provide excellent wear resistance with a low coefficient of thermal expansion and high modulus . 
Such alloys are in great demand for the automobile and aerospace industries . 
Moreover the ultrafine intermetallics , with their uniform distribution in the matrix , improve tremendously the strength and high - temperature stability of the alloy . 
The oversprayed powder particles of Al – 18Si – 5Fe – 1 . 5Cu alloy contain a dispersion of faceted Si particles coexisting with long needle - shaped intermetallics in the primary a - phase of Al . 
The solidification structure of different sized powder particles shows heterogeneous nucleation occurring from the surface of the droplet and the solid – liquid interface advancing in a diametrically opposite direction . 
The spray - deposited alloy had a fine - grained microstructure with uniform dispersion of ultrafine primary Si and rectangular - shaped plates of intermetallics in the a - Al matrix . 
In contrast , the spray - deposited and extruded alloy had dislocations present inside the Al grains / grain boundaries along with fragmented pieces of Si and intermetallics of a nanoscale size in the matrix . 
The EDS analysis of phases confirmed the formation of d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe phase in the powder particles . 
In contrast , the spray - deposited alloy contained the b - Al 5 SiFe phase in addition to the d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe phase . 
The formation of the b - Al 5 SiFe phase in the spray - deposited alloy is suggested to arise from the phase transformation of d - Al 4 Si 2 Fe during solidification of the deposit . 
Title : Microstructural characterization of in situ TiC / Al and TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg composites prepared by spray deposition 
An innovative spray - deposition technique has been applied to produce in situ TiC / Al and TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg composites . 
This technique provides a new route to solve the problems of losses and agglomeration of the reinforcement particles when they are injected into the spray cone of molten droplets during spray forming process . 
Experimental results have shown that the presence of needle - like Al 3 Ti and Al – Si – Fe compounds , which are detrimental not only to the fracture toughness , but also to the stability of the microstructure , can be eliminated completely from the final product by using a proper Ti : C molar ratio of 1 : 1 . 3 in the Ti – C – Al preforms and adding 5 wt % TiC particles to Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg alloy . 
Moreover , another major problem of coarsening of silicon particles usually encountered in the hypereutectic Al – Si alloys has also been solved by the technique . 
The silicon particles in the spray - deposited 5 wt % TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg composite were much refined ( ~ 2 μ m ) compared to those ( ~ 5 μ m ) obtained in the matrix alloy without TiC addition . 
The formation and elimination mechanisms of Al 3 Ti phase in TiC / Al composites can be explained based on thermodynamic theory . 
The modification of the microstructures in the spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg alloy can be interpreted in the light of the knowledge of atomic diffusion . 
The experimental results also showed that the ultimate tensile strength of the TiC / Al composites was improved over that of the unreinforced Al matrix . 
First , stoichiometric reactant ( Ti and C ) and an appropriate amount of matrix ( Al ) powders were mixed thoroughly . 
The compositions of the elemental powders used in this research are 4979 presented in Table 1 . 
The powder mixture was mechanically pressed into cylindrical preforms with a green density of 50 – 60 % . 
Two base materials are used in the present work . 
One is commercial purity aluminum ( approximate composition : 99 . 7 wt % Al , 0 . 15 wt % Si , 0 . 15 wt % Fe ) and the other is an Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg ( wt % ) alloy . 
The use of commercial purity aluminum as a base alloy has an advantage that the composite products are relatively simple , which is beneficial for elucidating the characteristics of the process . 
An amount of about 2 kg base material was melted and the melts were superheated to 900 ° C in an induction furnace . 
Then , 3 or 5 wt % reactant blocks were inserted into the molten base materials . 
When all reactions were completed ( the end point of the reaction can be determined after observing the dazzling light originated from the reacted melt ) , the melts were degassed by using C 2 Cl 6 at 730 ° C . 
The processes were carried out in air . 
The composite slurry is then atomized and deposited . 
The spray - deposition processing parameters are briefly summarized as follows . 
The melts were superheated to 820 ° C and atomized using nitrogen gas at 0 . 8 MPa pressure . 
The atomizer – substrate distance was 390 mm , and a delivery tube with a diameter of 3 . 3 mm was used . 
The liquid slurry is disintegrated into micro - size composite droplets which are deposited on to a substrate and collected as bulk TiC / Al and TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg composites . 
The spray - deposited specimens had a cylindrical disc shape with a diameter of about 120 mm . 
The microstructure of the spray - deposited specimens was revealed by etching in a solution of mixed acids ( 2 ml HF + 3 ml HCl + 5 ml HNO 4 + 250 ml H 2 O ) . 
The polished and etched specimens were examined under a CAMBRIDGE S360 scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) fitted with an energy - dispersive X - ray ( EDX ) analysis system . 
X - ray diffraction ( XRD ) analysis was carried out with a Rigaku diffractometer using Cu K α radiation ( 40 kV / 25 mA ) . 
Fine microstructural features were evaluated using an H - 800 transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) operated at 120 kV . 
TEM disc - shaped specimens were prepared by using ion - beam thinning at a current of 0 . 5 mA and an inclination angle of 12 ° . 
The tensile properties of the TiC / Al composites were examined using an MTS - 810 test machine at a constant crosshead speed of 0 . 5 mm / min . 
Tensile testing specimens with a 3 mm gauge width and 3 mm gauge length were tested at room temperature . 
Fig . 1 shows a typical SEM microstructure of the spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg alloy , which is mainly composed of a - Al , plate - shaped Si ( dark gray ) and needle - like second phases ( light gray ) . 
The Si particles have an average size of 5 μ m . 
The needle - like second phase , being randomly distributed in the matrix , was about 2 – 5 μ m in length , as shown in Fig . 1 . 
EDX analysis showed that the needle - like second phase contains elements of Al , Si and Fe [ 44 ] . 
XRD was performed to identify the second phase and the result is shown in Fig . 2 . 
Analysis of the diffraction pattern shows that the needle - like phases are a mixture of tetragonal d - Al 4 FeSi 2 and monoclinic b - Al 5 FeSi compounds . 
In other words , the metastable d - Al 4 FeSi 2 and equilibrium b - Al 5 FeSi compounds co - exist in the spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg alloy . 
The presence of d - Al 4 FeSi 2 and b - Al 5 FeSi in the needle - like compounds was further confirmed by electron diffraction . 
Figs . 3 and Fig . 4 gave two examples of diffraction pattern analysis for the needle - like compounds . 
The TEM results are in good agreement with the XRD results , as shown in Fig . 2 . 
No notable difference in the morphology between d - Al 4 FeSi 2 and b - Al 5 FeSi compounds can be found , as shown in Figs . 3 and 4 . 
By means of XRD , the phases in the TiC / Al composite were analyzed , and the experimental results are shown in Fig . 5 ( a ) . 
In addition to the expected TiC and Al peaks , one can see that Al 3 Ti peak is also present in the alloy . 
Al 3 Ti is observed to be in strip or rectangular structure with a mean size over 20 μ m [ 45 ] , which will be detrimental to the plasticity of the composites . 
In our previous work [ 45 ] , we found that the tensile elongation of the 3 wt % TiC / Al composite with Al 3 Ti was only 4 % that is much lower than the value of unreinforced aluminum ( 20 % ) , as shown in Table 2 . 
Moreover , the higher the Ti content , the more strip or rectangular Al 3 Ti phase intends to form in the composite . 
It indicates that the titanium content with a ratio of Ti : C = 1 : 1 may be slightly excessive . 
Therefore , other experiments were performed with a Ti to C molar ratio of 1 : 2 ( Fig . 5 ( b ) ) . 
It shows that Al 3 Ti is absent in the final product within the precision of the X - ray method . 
Al 4 C 3 and C peaks , however , are present in the composite . 
It shows that the carbon content in the preforms with Ti : C = 1 : 2 is relatively excessive . 
Al 4 C 3 is certainly not a desirable constituent in the composites as it is also a brittle compound that decomposes readily when exposed to atmospheric moisture . 
Furthermore , the fluidity of the melt was found to be severely impaired when it was processed within the Al 4 C 3 - formation range [ 46 ] . 
Fig . 5 ( c ) , ( d ) shows the XRD patterns of the composites with the Ti to C molar ratios of 1 : 1 . 8 and 1 : 1 . 5 , respectively . 
Al 4 C 3 and C peaks are still present in the composite with Ti : C = 1 : 1 . 8 , as shown in Fig . 5 ( c ) . 
The reacted preforms in which the Ti to C molar ratio was 1 : 1 . 5 were taken out immediately when all reactions were completed ( the end point of the reaction can be determined as mentioned above ) . 
The use of reacted preform as a sample has an advantage that some phases , especially with a small amount , can be characterized by XRD . 
Fig . 5 ( d ) shows the phases of the reacted preform ( powders ) with Ti : C = 1 : 1 . 5 . 
Al 4 C 3 and C peaks are still present in the reacted powders even though their peaks are very weak . 
Fig . 6 represents a typical SEM microstructure of the composite with a Ti to C molar ratio of 1 : 1 . 2 . 
With the increase of Ti to C molar ratio ( from 1 : 1 to 1 : 1 . 2 ) , the strip or rectangular Al 3 Ti was enormously decreased . 
An optimum carbon content in Ti – C – Al preforms with Ti : C = 1 : 1 . 3 was finally determined . 
Under such a condition , no Al 3 Ti , Al 4 C 3 and residual C can be found in the final product within the precision of the X - ray method ( Fig . 5 ( e ) ) . 
It shows that the phase constitution consists of Al and TiC in the composites . 
OM photomicrograph of the 3 wt % TiC / Al composite is shown in Fig . 7 . 
No Al 3 Ti , Al 4 C 3 and residual graphite can be found in the composite and that the composite has sound structure . 
The tensile elongation of this composite was 10 % ( Table 2 ) , much higher than the value of the composite with Al 3 Ti ( 4 % ) . 
Moreover , improvement in tensile elongation of the composite was accompanied by an increase of the ultimate tensile strength ( UTS ) ( Table 2 ) . 
TEM examination of the composites indicates that the majority of the fine TiC particles fabricated with this technique are equiaxed ( Fig . 8 ) . 
Clearly , the negative impact of the equiaxed TiC particles on plasticity of the composite is less than that of the composites reinforced by sharp particles . 
Based on the results of successfully eliminating Al 3 Ti , Al 4 C 3 and residual graphite in the TiC / Al composites , we prepared spray - deposited TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg composites . 
Fig . 9 shows typical SEM microstructures of the spray - deposited 3 and 5 wt % TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg composites . 
It is readily seen that the distribution of TiC particles is uniform . 
Essentially , this can be attributed to the combined effect of the disintegration of a molten stream into micro - size droplets during atomization and the minimized particle migration in a mushy layer present during deposition . 
It is worth noting that the TiC addition leads to the change of microstructure of the needle - like ternary Al – Si – Fe compounds . 
With the addition of 3 wt % TiC particles , the needle - like compounds were decreased ( Fig . 9 ( a ) ) . 
While the compounds were eliminated completely from the final product when 5 wt % TiC particles were added ( Fig . 9 ( b ) ) . 
Table 2 compares the mechanical properties of the spray - deposited TiC / Al composites . 
The results indicated that the TiC / Al composites exhibit relatively higher strengths than the value of unreinforced aluminum . 
For example , as shown in Table 2 , the UTS of the spray - deposited commercial Al is 124 MPa , whereas 3 wt % TiC / Al composites with and without Al 3 Ti have values of 137 . 1 and 148 . 6 MPa , respectively . 
As expected , the tensile elongations ( El ) of the composites are reduced significantly as a result of the presence of ceramic reinforcements . 
As mentioned previously , d - Al 4 FeSi 2 and b - Al 5 FeSi phases are always present in the spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg alloy . 
The b - Al 5 FeSi phase has a monoclinic crystal structure with lattice constants of a = 6 . 12 Å , b = 6 . 12 Å , c = 41 . 5 Å and α = 91 ° , which is less symmetric and more complex than tetragonal d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase with lattice constants of a = 6 . 12 – 6 . 16 Å and c = 9 . 48 – 9 . 49 Å [ 55 ] . 
According to the Al – Si – Fe ternary phase diagram [ 56 ] , the primary solidifying phase is d - Al 4 FeSi 2 . 
The transformations L → d - Al 4 FeSi 2 and L → d - Al 4 FeSi 2 + Si occur at about 710 ° C . 
Below 610 ° C , the formed d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase transforms into the b - Al 5 FeSi phase . 
At about 576 ° C , the ternary eutecticum consisting of the α - Al , Si and b - Al 5 FeSi phase is reached . 
The formation of b - Al 5 FeSi phase in this transformation is known to be very slow [ 56 ] . 
After the first stage of transformation , d - Al 4 FeSi 2 is surrounded by b - Al 5 FeSi which is a reaction product . 
Further transformation can only occur through solid state diffusion which is very slow . 
In Al – Si – Fe – Cu – Mg alloy , a more complex sequence of phase transformation occurs . 
For this alloy , there is no appropriate equilibrium phase diagram available . 
It is well known that the sequence of equilibrium solidification events can - not be followed in spray - deposited hypereutectic Al – Si – Fe – Cu – Mg alloys . 
According to the SEM , EDX and XRD results , we could assume that the solidification of the spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg alloy droplets occurs in the following sequence . 
In the beginning of solidification , meta - stable d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase is crystallized , then primary Si nucleates on the d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase and grows . 
It has been confirmed by Timmermans et al . [ 57 ] . 
Finally , the remaining liquid solidified into an irregular ternary eutectic of a - Al , Si and d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phases . 
Zhou and Duszczyk [ 58 ] noted that , except for the Si phases ( including eutectic phase and primary Si crystals ) , the metastable d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase was predominant in the spray - deposited microstructure and the volume fraction of the equilibrium b - Al 5 FeSi phase was relatively small . 
The high volume fraction of metastable d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase in the spray - deposited microstructure may be attributed to two primary reasons . 
First , the tendency of metastable phase formation in Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg alloy is relatively strong . 
Therefore , extensive precipitation of the d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase should occur during the atomization stage . 
Second , the kinetics associated with the metastable - to - equilibrium phase transition in this alloy is relatively sluggish . 
The reason for the formation of b - Al 5 FeSi phase is associated with the thermal condition of impinging droplets . 
The solidification process during spray - deposition occurs in two stages : gas atomization ( rapid cooling ) and droplet consolidation ( relatively slow cooling ) . 
In case of gas atomization , the d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase is able to form within droplets to some extent before deposition . 
Upon droplet deposition , an abrupt fall in solidification rate occurs within the deposited layer . 
At this time , the d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase originated from the droplets can be readily transferred into the stable b - Al 5 FeSi phase due to slow cooling ( or annealing ) effect and the fact that d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase is extremely metastable . 
The basic principle of the innovative spray - deposition technique for making TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg composites is that the submicron TiC particles are produced in situ in a molten alloy by exothermic reactions between elements . 
TiC has high melting point and is thermodynamically very stable . 
TiC has been synthesized in the melt matrix before the metastable d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase is crystallized . 
From Fig . 8 , one can see that all TiC particles within the matrix are significantly refined compared with the original graphite and titanium particles . 
The starting carbon particles were as large as 50 mm , while the TiC particles are less than 0 . 7 mm in reacted preforms . 
Most importantly , the fine TiC particles are not only round in shape but also very uniform in size , which strongly indicates that the formation of TiC is achieved via a mechanism of nucleation and growth [ 45 , 59 ] . 
Moreover , the TiC particles with a fine submicron size and with a narrow size distribution suggest that their nucleation be easier than their growth . 
The reason why the addition of in situ TiC particles can modify microstructures of the spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg alloy may be attributed to the following factors . 
First , the presence of TiC particles increases the nucleation kinetics of d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase by increasing the density of nuclei in the melt , which is beneficial to the formation of fine d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase . 
Second , the impacting of melt droplets containing TiC particles into the semi - solidified layer during spray - deposition made initially formed d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase with a needle like morphology to be broken into small particles , which decreased the size of d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase and increased its number of solidification nuclei . 
Third , the addition of 5 wt % TiC particle creates a high volume fraction of dispersed particles which are broken up during redistributed on a fine scale at grain and subgrain boundaries , as well as within grains . 
These may act effectively as sinks for vacancies and obstacles to the diffusion of silicon atoms over a long distance , particularly along the grain and subgrain boundaries with which the TiC particles interact . 
As a result , the growth of silicon particles becomes difficult and their coarsening rate is relatively reduced . 
It has been shown that the silicon particles dispersed in the matrix alloy have a strong propensity to coarsening when they are exposed to high temperatures [ 60 , 61 ] , which may in turn promote the recrystallization of the matrix . 
The fact that silicon particles can be refined by in situ formed TiC particles in the Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg alloy is very important for the processing and application of hypereutectic Al – Si alloys . 
According to the experimental results mentioned above , one can see that in addition to providing dispersion strengthening and modifying matrix microstructure , the addition of TiC particles may also play an important role in delaying the coarsening of silicon particles in the hypereutectic Al – Si alloys . 
More recently , we found that the sharp angled block Al 6 Fe phase in spray - deposited Al – Fe – V – Si alloys can be also substituted by spherical phase by adding TiC particles in the alloys [ 62 ] . 
This indicates the novel spray - deposition technique , based on our present investigation , may find application in some areas where the microstructures of modification are required such as in spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg and Al - Fe - V - Si alloys . 
The strengthening behavior of spray - deposited MMCs is related to factors such as reinforcement volume fraction , matrix strength and temper condition . 
Ibrahim et al . [ 63 ] compared the strength values of spray - deposited monolithic alloys and MMCs to those of equivalent materials produced using ingot metallurgy ( IM ) and powder metallurgy ( P / M ) and obtained three important conclusions . 
First , when compared with the IM alloy , the spray - deposited MMCs and unreinforced matrix exhibit a higher strength . 
The strength of the P / M formed MMCs is , however , greater than that of the spray - deposited materials . 
Lavernia [ 64 ] and Ibrahim et al . [ 63 ] attributed the higher strength that is commonly observed in P / M formed MMCs to the refined matrix microstructure and the presence of a dispersion of oxide particles . 
Second , under the conditions of lower matrix strength , the incorporation of ceramic reinforcements generally leads to improved strength . 
This is evidenced by the higher strength of the spray - deposited 6061 / SiC MMCs relative to that of the unreinforced matrix after the T4 temper [ 65 ] . 
Third , when the matrix is treated to a higher strength , the incorporation of SiC reinforcements may lead to either strengthening or weakening depending on the reinforcement volume fraction . 
For example , under the T6 temper condition , the strength of the MMCs is lower relative to that of the unreinforced materials at lower reinforcement volume fractions ( e . g . , ⬍ 17 vol . % ) . 
It is , however , higher than that of the unreinforced matrices at high reinforcement volume fractions ( e . g . , ⬎ 17 vol . % ) . 
As shown in Table 2 , the UTS of the TiC / Al composites at room temperature was improved over that of the unreinforced Al matrix . 
The adequate improvement in strength may be attributed to the strong interfacial bonding between the TiC particles and the Al matrix . 
Lavernia and Wu [ 65 ] suggested that there should be a critical reinforcement volume fraction , above which incorporation of reinforcements leads to strengthening , and below which reinforcements lead to weakening . 
The fluidity of a composite slurry , however , decreases with increasing particle volume fraction using this method . 
Consequently , at high reinforcement volume fractions , it may be difficult to deliver the composite slurry into a gas atomizer . 
Viscosity , therefore , presents a limit to the volume fraction of reinforcements that can be successfully incorporated using this method . 
Obviously , the spray - deposition processing parameters , including superheat , atomizer – substrate distance , delivery tube diameter , and gas / liquid ratio must be further optimized . 
A novel spray - deposition technique , with which TiC particles are formed by in situ reactions in matrix melt , has been successfully applied to produce TiC / Al and TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg composites . 
This technique provides a new route to solve the problems of agglomeration and losses of particles associated with the traditional spray - deposition MMCs processing technique . 
The needle - like Al 3 Ti phase is always present in TiC / Al composites when the Ti : C molar ratio is 1 : 1 in the preforms . 
The brittle Al 3 Ti phase can be eliminated entirely from the final product by using a proper Ti : C molar ratio of 1 : 1 . 3 in the Ti – C – Al preforms . 
The microstructure of spray - deposited Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg alloy is composed of the a - Al , plate - shaped Si and the needle - like second phases . 
Experimental results have shown that the presence of the needle - like compounds can be eliminated completely with the addition of 5 wt % TiC particles to the alloy . 
It may be attributed to the fact that the presence of TiC particles increases the nucleation kinetics of d - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase by increasing the density of nuclei in the melt and that the impacting of melt droplets containing TiC particles into the semi - solidified layer during spray - deposition made initially formed needle - like δ - Al 4 FeSi 2 phase to be broken into small particles . 
The silicon particles in the spray - deposited 5 wt % TiC / Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 3Cu – 1Mg composite were much refined ( ~ 2 mm ) compared to those ( ~ 5 mm ) obtained in the matrix alloy without TiC addition . 
The refinement of silicon particles indicated that the addition of TiC particle could create a higher volume fraction of dispersed particles , and act effectively as sinks for vacancies and obstacles to the diffusion of silicon atoms over a long distance . 
As a result , the coarsening rate of silicon particles is relatively reduced . 
The UTSs of the TiC / Al composites were improved over that of the unreinforced Al matrix . 
Title : Effect of rapid solidification on the microstructure and mechanical properties of hot - pressed Al – 20Si – 5Fe alloys 
The aim of this work is to study the effect of cooling rate and subsequent hot consolidation on the microstructural features and mechanical strength of Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 2X ( X = Cu , Ni and Cr ) alloys . 
Powder and ribbons were produced by gas atomization and melt spinning processes at two different cooling rates of 1 × 10 5 K / s and 5 × 10 7 K / s . 
The microstructure of the products was examined using optical microscopy , scanning electron microscopy , transmission electron microscopy , and X - ray diffraction . 
The particles were consolidated by hot pressing at 400 ° C / 250 MPa / 1 h under a high purity argon atmosphere and the microstructure , hardness and compressive strength of the compacts were evaluated . 
Results showed a profound effect of the cooling rate , consolidation stage , and transition metals on the microstructure and mechanical strength of Al – 20Si – 5Fe alloys . 
While microstructural refining was obtained at both cooling rates , the microstructure of the atomized powder exhibited the formation of fine primary silicon ( ~ 1 μ m ) , eutectic Al – Si phase with eutectic spacing of ~ 300 nm , and δ - iron intermetallic . 
Supersaturated Al matrix containing 5 – 7 at . % silicon and nanometric Si precipitates ( 20 – 40 nm ) were determined in the microstructure of the melt - spun ribbons . 
The hot consolidation resulted in coarsening of Si particles in the atomized particles , and precipitation of Si and Fe - containing intermetallics from the supersaturated Al matrix in the ribbons . 
The consolidated ribbons exhibited higher mechanical strength compared to the atomized powders , particularly at elevated temperatures . 
The positive influence of the transition metals on the thermal stability of the Al – 20Si – 5Fe alloy was noticed , particularly in the Ni - containing alloy . 
Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 2X ( X = Cu , Ni , Cr ) alloys ( nominal composition in wt . % ) were prepared by melting commercially pure metals in a graphite crucible in air . 
Powders were produced by nitrogen atomization of the superheated melts at 1120 ± 10 K at the gas pressure of 0 . 8 MPa . 
The particles are irregular in shape and the particle size distribution is broad ( Fig . 1a ) . 
The powders were sieved and the particles with the size range of 25 – 63 μ m were used for the subsequent examinations . 
Fig . 1b and c show a scanning electron micrograph and the size distribution of the powder particles after sieving . 
Ribbons were produced by the chill - block melt spinning process by means of impinging a jet of molten alloy onto the cylindrical surface of a copper wheel with a diameter of 23 cm rotating at 40 m / s . 
The crucible orifice for ejecting the melt was 0 . 7 mm . 
The temperature of the melt before ejection was 1020 ± 10 K . 
The dimensions of the as - produced ribbons were 2 mm in width and 20 – 40 μ m in thickness . 
The rapidly solidified ribbons were pulverized by milling in a Tumbling mixer / miller in a plastic box containing 10 mm hardened chrome steel balls with the ball to choppedribbon weight ratio of 10 : 1 for 30 min . 
The obtained powders were sieved and particles with sizes less than 106 μ m were used for consolidation . 
Fig . 2 shows a representative scanning electron micrograph of the pulverized ribbons after sieving . 
Various techniques were used to characterize the products . The particle size distribution was examined using a laser particle size analyzer ( Expert 95 , Fritsch , Germany ) . 
The morphology of the particles was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy ( Tescan VEGA Ι Ι XMU , Czech Republic ) . Phase characterization was performed by X - ray diffraction ( XRD , Philips Xpert ) using Cu K α radiation ( λ = 1 . 5406 Å ) at 2 θ - step of 0 . 02 ° and scanning duration of 1 s from 15 ° to 80 ° . 
The hardness of the powder particles was measured with a Vickers diamond indenter in a micro - hardness tester ( Micromet 2100 , Buehler , USA ) at applied load of 10 g . 
The microstructural examinations were conducted by an optical microscope ( Olym - pus BX51M , Japan ) and scanning electron microscopy coupled with an energy - dispersive X - ray analyzer . 
In order to reveal the details of the microstructure , the alloys were electrochemically etched in a solution comprising 33 % HNO 3 and 67 % H 2 O for 3 s . The voltage and current were 10 – 15 DC V and 5 – 10A , respectively . 
The size and morphology of the primary silicon and intermetallic phases were characterized by using Clemex Vision image analyzer ( PE 4 , Clemex Technologies Inc . , Canada ) . 
The reported values are the average of 100 measurements . 
Transmission electron microscopy ( CM200 , Philips ) coupled with electron - dispersive X - ray spectroscopy was also employed to study the microstructure of the ribbons . 
Hot pressing was performed to consolidate the powders into small cylindrical specimens with 10 mm diameter and 5 mm height . 
The process was performed in a steel die coated with boron nitride under a high purity argon atmosphere . 
The heating rate , compaction pressure , temperature and dwell time were 10 K / min , 250 MPa , 673 K , and 60 min , respectively . 
After consolidation , the density of the compacts was measured using the water displacement method according to ASTM B311 - 93 . 
The density was found to be ~ 99 % . 
The phase characterization and microstructural features of the consolidated samples were examined by X - ray diffraction , optical microscopy and electron microscopy as explained above . 
Compression test was used to determine the strength of the compacts . 
A servo control universal testing machine ( Gotech , AI - 7000 L , China ) at the strain rate of 1 . 66 × 10 − 3 s − 1 was utilized . 
The testing temperatures were 298 , 473 and 573 K . 
The Vickers hardness of the compacts was determined using a hardness tester ( Instron Wolpert , Germany ) at the indentation load of 30 kg . 
Fig . 3 shows the microstructure of gas - atomized and melt - spun Al – 20Si – 5Fe alloy . 
The microstructure of the atomized particle consisted of particle - like Si , fine eutectic Al – Si phase and an acicular intermetallic compound ( Fig . 3a and b ) . 
The average size of the primary Si particles and the eutectic spacing is 1 ± 0 . 3 μ m and 300 ± 40 nm , respectively . 
Scanning electron study coupled with energy - dispersive X - ray analysis indicated that the inter - metallic phase is an iron - containing compound with a length of 3 . 6 ± 0 . 5 μ m and an aspect ratio of 4 ± 0 . 3 . 
The micro - hardness measurement of the particles indicated a value of 196 ± 6 HV 0 . 01 which is significantly higher than that of the cast alloy with the approximate composition of Al – 20Si – 3 . 3Fe ( 84 ± 5 . 4 HV 0 . 025 [ 9 ] ) . 
Fig . 3c shows an optical micrograph taken from the as - solidified ribbon . 
A featureless zone with an average thickness of 6 μ m is seen in the wheel - side . 
In the free - side , the microstructure is dendritic , which has an average arm spacing of about 150 ± 20 nm ( Fig . 3d ) . 
Fig . 4 shows a bright - field transmission electron image and selected area diffraction pattern of the ribbon . 
Fine distribution of spherical Si particles with an average size of 30 ± 10 nm is seen . 
No evidence of the intermetallic phase formation could be noticed . 
The micro - hardness analysis indicates value of 350 ± 8HV 0 . 01 for the cross section of ribbon . 
Fig . 5 shows the X - ray diffraction patterns of the rapidly solidified Al – 20Si – 5Fe alloy . 
The pattern of the gas - atomized powder exhibits the diffraction peaks of α - Al , diamond - cubic Si , and tetragonal δ - Al 4 FeSi 2 ( Fig . 5 ( a ) ) in agreement with its microstructure ( Fig . 3a and b ) . 
The X - ray diffraction peaks of the wheel - and free - side of the ribbon are shown in Fig . 5 ( b ) and ( c ) . 
Only diffraction peaks of the aluminum and low - intensity peaks of Si are visible . 
This indicates over - equili - brium dissolution of Si in the aluminum lattice due to high undercooling . 
Besides the X - ray diffraction limitation indetecting low volume concentrations ( typically 5 vol . % [ 9 ] ) , the absence of the intermetallic phase at X - ray diffraction pattern also reveals the extended solid solubility of the matrix . 
Similar to the Al – 20Si – 5Fe alloy , the microstructure and phase formation of the rapidly solidified powders containing Cu , Ni and Cr were studied . 
The only noticeable difference was related to the effect of Cr on the morphology and size of the primary Si and the iron - containing intermetallic . 
Fig . 6a shows the microstructural features of the Al alloy with 2 wt . % Cr addition after electrochemical etching to reveal the details . 
EDS analyses on a Si particle and an intermetallic particle are observed in Fig . 6b and c , respectively . 
The X - ray diffraction pattern is shown in Fig . 6d . 
It is noticeable that the morphology of the acicular intermetallic is changed to spherical shape in the presence of Cr while the composition remained unchanged ( tetragonal δ - Al 4 FeSi 2 ) . 
It is also visible that the average size of the Si particles and the intermetallic phase is almost half of the alloy without chromium ( see Fig . 3a and b ) . 
In addition , a higher hardness ( 221 ± 5 HV 0 . 01 ) was obtained when 2 wt . % Cr was added to the ternary alloy . 
When melt spinning was carried out , the effect of transition metals on the microstructure and phase formation was marginal ; no significant differences could be noticed . 
For instance , Fig . 7 shows a bright - field transmission electron micrograph and X - ray diffraction pattern of the Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 2Cr ribbon . 
Nanometric Si particles are distributed in the aluminum matrix ( Fig . 7a ) . 
The Si precipitates are finer compared to the base alloy shown in Fig . 4a . 
No new phases are noticed in the diffraction pattern ( Fig . 7b ) . 
The gas - atomized powders and pulverized melt - spun ribbons were hot pressed into bulk cylindrical shapes and the microstructure and mechanical strength of the compacts were examined . 
Fig . 8 shows the microstructural features of Al – 20Si – 5Fe alloy . 
The primary silicon and acicular intermetallic compound are visible which have almost the same size as in the powder state ( Fig . 8a ) . 
In contrast with the atomized powder , the microstructure of the melt - spun ribbon undergoes remarkable change . 
As seen in Fig . 8b for compacts manufactured from the melt - spun ribbons , fine silicon particles are formed . 
Fig . 9 shows the X - ray diffraction patterns of the consolidated powders . 
The diffraction peaks of α - Al and Si phases are identifiable in the both materials . 
The higher intensity of ( 111 ) Si peak and the shift in the Al lines to lower 2 θ angles , particularly in the case of ribbon , indicate Si precipitation during the hot consolidation process . 
The X - ray diffraction pattern of the compacts also shows the presence of β - Al 5 FeSi phase . 
It seems that the δ - intermetallic was transformed to stable β - phase during processing of the gas - atomized powder . 
Microstructural study of the alloys containing the transition metals indicated similar results . 
Except Cr which refined the microstructure , no significant effect of Cu and Ni on the microstructural features could be outlined . 
Fig . 10a shows the microstructure of gas - atomized Al – 20Si – 5Fe – 2Cr alloy after hot consolidation and electrochemical etching . 
The microstructure is rather similar to that of the ternary alloy but the acicular intermetallic phase is in fine spherical shape . 
Transmission electron study revealed that Si coarsening occurred during hot consolidation of the pulverized ribbon ( Fig . 10b ) . 
In addition , nanometric precipitation of ironcontaining intermetallic occurred ( see electron - dispersive X - ray spectrum shown in Fig . 10c ) . 
X - ray diffraction analysis indicated the composition of the intermetallic phase as Al95Fe4Cr ( Fig . 10d ) . 
The hardness and compressive strength of the hot - pressed powders and ribbons are reported in Table 1 . 
For comparison , the hardness of conventionally cast alloys with the same compositions is listed [ 16 ] . 
One can notice the higher hardness of the compacts produced by the rapid solidification processes compared with the conventionally cast alloys . 
Higher hardness was obtained when melt spinning was performed . 
The positive influence of the transition metals on the hardness was also noticeable . 
Similar results were obtained from the compression test , i . e . rapid solidification and alloying with the transition metals improved the strength , particularly at the elevated temperatures . 
Nickel was found to be the most effective element in increasing the strength . 
The effect of cooling rate and transition alloying elements on the microstructure and mechanical strength of as - solidified and hot - pressed Al – 20Si – 5Fe alloy was studied . 
The findings can be summarized as follow . 
The microstructure of gas - atomized powder ( cooling rate of 1 × 10 5 K / s ) consisted of particle - like Si , fine eutectic Si and iron - containing intermetallic compound ( δ - phase ) . 
Increasing the cooling rate to 5 × 10 7 K / s by melt spinning resulted in supersaturation of the aluminum matrix and the formation of nanometric Si precipitates . 
No appreciable effect of Cu and Ni on the microstructural features of the gas - atomized powder was noticed . 
Cr altered the morphology of the iron - containing intermetallic compound and refined the primary silicon particles . 
The hardness of the rapidly solidified powders was almost double of the conventionally cast ( low cooling rate ) alloys . 
The microstructure of the melt - spun ribbons exhibited a featureless zone caused by diffusionless solidification and a dendritic zone in the free - side due to the lower undercooling . 
After hot consolidation of the gas - atomized powders , the microstructural changes included transformation of metastable δ - phase to stable β - phase and coarsening of silicon particles . 
The microstructure of the hot - pressed pulverized ribbons included ultrafine Si particles ( 150 – 200 nm ) and nanometric iron - containing intermetallic compound . 
The addition of transition metals significantly improved the hardness and compressive strength of Al – 20Si – 5Fe alloy . 
Here , nickel was found to be more effective . 
An improved mechanical strength was obtained when the higher cooling rate was employed . 
Title : Microstructure , thermo - physical and mechanical properties of spray - deposited Si – 30Al alloy for electronic packaging application 
In this study , Si – 30Al alloy was synthesized by the spray atomization and deposition technique . 
The microstructure and properties of the alloy were studied using optical microscopy , scanning electron microscopy , coefficient of thermal expansion ( CTE ) and thermal conductivity ( TC ) measurements , and 3 - point bending tests . 
It was found that the microstructure of the alloy after hot pressing is composed of a continuous network of globular primary Si and interpenetrating secondary Al - rich phase . 
The property measurements results indicate that the spray - deposited 70Si30Al alloy has advantageous physical and mechanical characteristics , including low coefficient of thermal expansion ( 6 . 8 × 10 − ^ 6 / K ) , high thermal conductivity ( 118 W / mK ) , low density ( 2 . 42 gcm − ^ 3 ) , high ultimate flexural strength ( 180 MPa ) and Brinell hardness ( 261 ) . 
The nominal composition of the alloy was 70 wt . % Si and 30 wt . % Al . 
The spray - deposition experiments were conducted in a SF - 200 type environmental chamber ( manufactured by General Research Institute for Nonferrous Metals , Beijing , China ) . 
During spray - deposition process , the molten metal was atomized by N2 at 1300 ° C , the distance of atomizing deposition was kept constant at 550 mm . 
For the densification , the perform , after being cut into cylindrical billets was hot pressed for 4 h at a temperature of 570 ° C with a pressure of 240 MPa . 
After hot pressing , the materials were cooled in air . 
The microstructures of the alloy were characterized using light optical microscope ( LOM ) and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) . 
Coefficient of thermal expansion ( CTE ) measurements were conducted on Formastor - Digital tester with a heating rate of 5 ° C / min . 
Thermal conductivity measurements were performed on TCT 416 ( NETZSCH Corporation ) at 50 ° C . 
The 3 - point bending tests with 30 mm span were carried out at room temperature on an Instron 5569 universal electron tension testing system . 
Brinell hardness measurements were performed on a HBV - 30 double - purpose tester with a 1 mm ball indenter . 
Fig . 1 shows optical micrographs of as - cast and as - spraydeposited and hot pressed Si – 30Al alloy for comparison . 
It can be seen that the optical microscopy microstructure of as - cast alloy is composed of the large block - like primary Si phases and coarse flake eutectic , in Fig . 1 ( a ) . 
Some microcracks exist in Si phases , especially in coarse ones , and thus result in the crack growth or even new crack initiation under presence of the stress . 
Fig . 1 ( b ) shows the LOM microstructure of as - spraydeposited and hot pressed alloy , which is composed of a continuous network of globular primary Si and interpenetrating secondary Al - rich phase . 
Network of globular primary Si is surrounded by an Al - rich phases . 
The presence of the globular primary Si was attributed to the high cooling rate , associated with the rapid solidification processes . 
Fig . 2 ( a ) represents a scanning electron micrograph of spray - deposited and hot pressed Si – 30Al alloy . 
Elemental map scan traces of Si and Al in the microstructure shown in Fig . 2 ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively . 
It can be seen that spray - deposited alloy exhibited no Al – Si eutectic in inter - Si regions , and instead these regions consisted of a single Al - rich phase . 
The formation of the globular primary Si phase in the spray - deposited Si – 30Al alloy resulted mainly from the relativity high cooling rates during spraydeposition , which has the intrinsic ability to alter the morphological stability of the Si phase . 
Furthermore , impact deformation and fracture experienced by the partially solidified droplets during spray - deposition may also effectively break the Si phase that formed prior to the deposition stage . 
The presence of such Si phase lead to the increase of the number density of nuclei in the top layer of the spraydeposited material , and effectively inhibited the formation of eutectic Al – Si during deposition . 
Table 1 summarizes some key property data for spraydeposited Si – 30Al alloy and other electronic packaging materials . 
From the applications of electronic packaging materials , it is found that the Kovar and Invar have been the preferred packaging materials because of its welding capacity and its CTE that is compatible with those of semiconductors . 
However , these materials suffer from poor thermal conductivity and high density . 
Cu and Al are often used as baseplates of power modules for their good thermal conductivities , but their CTEs are much higher than desired for attachment of substrates . 
Alumina is also used quite often in electronic packaging applications , although it has the advantages of low density and CTE , its thermal conductivity is rather low . 
Al - 68 % SiC composite combines the benefits of compatible and tailorable CTE , high thermal conductivity and low density , it is a pity that the composite with high SiC content is not easily machinable . 
Beryllia composites , with perfect thermophysical properties , low density and high modulus , are restricted by their toxicity . 
By contrast , The density of spray - deposited 70Si30Al alloy achieved in this study is only one - third that of Kovar , Invar and Cu , and lower than Al – 68 % SiC , BeO and Al , but its TC is nine times that of Kovar or Invar and three times that of alumina . 
From Table 1 , it can be seen that the values of the Brinell hardness and Flexural strength were 261 and 180 MPa , respectively . 
It is beneficial for the packaging materials to have a reasonable stiffness to provide adequate mechanical support for mechanically sensitive components and substrates . 
Obviously , spray - deposited 70Si30Al alloy exhibits lower density , CTE and higher TC , will have a good potential in electron packaging applications . 
Based on the results of this study on 70Si30Al alloy fabricated using spray - deposition technique , the following conclusions can be drawn : The microstructure of spray - deposited 70Si30Al alloy after hot pressing is composed of a continuous network of globular primary Si and interpenetrating secondary Al - rich phase . The thermo - physical characteristics of spray - deposited 70Si30Al alloy combine low coefficient of thermal expansion , high thermal conductivity and low density . 
Additionally , the alloy has a reasonable stiffness and adequate flexural strength . 
This makes them ideal candidate materials for electronic packaging and thermal management . 
Title : The effect of Mn on the microstructure of spray - deposited Al - 20Si - 5Fe - 3Cu - 1Mg alloy 
Hypereutectic Al ± Si alloys are known to be suitable for use as piston materials due to their low coefficient of thermal expansion ( CTE ) and good wear resistance . 
In order to improve the mechanical properties of hypereutectic Al - Si alloys , it is necessary to make composition modi ® cations by adding alloying elements like Cu , Mg , Fe and Ni to the alloys [ 1 ] . 
Although the addition of Cu and Mg may improve the strength of Al alloys substantially through precipitation hardening , the precipitates are not stable at temperatures higher than 150 ° C with the result of the rapid decrease in strength at high temperature . 
Therefore , it is essential to add alloying elements to form stable precipitates at high temperature . 
Recently , focus has been shifted to the continuous improvement in the elevated temperature strength of rapidly solidi ® ed hypereutectic Al - Si alloys [ 2 - 4 ] . 
This is mainly due to the fact that the alloys are needed in various high temperatures circumstances , such as in automotive engines [ 1 , 5 ] . 
It has been reported that Fe is effective in improving high temperature strength [ 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 ] . 
When added with a certain proportion to Al - Si alloys , Fe forms a volume fraction of thermally stable intermetallic compounds , and results in a considerable improvement in the hightemperature performance of these materials . 
Unfortunately , the iron - containing intermetallic compounds formed in spray - deposited hypereutectic Al - Si alloys , such as δ - Al4FeSi2 and β - Al5FeSi , tend to form as needles [ 5 - 7 ] . 
Undoubtedly , the needle - like compounds are very harmful not only to the fracture toughness , but also to the effectiveness of stabilizing the microstructure [ 8 ] . 
It has been proven that alloying elements such as Mn and Cr can change the morphology of the iron - containing intermetallic compounds [ 9 , 10 ] . 
Mn in small quantities is beneficial in the refinement of the microstructure , particularly when iron is present . 
The addition of Mn expands basically the Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 phase ( Chinese script morphology in cast aluminum alloys ) , making the crystallization of Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 phase possible even at high iron contents [ 11 ] . 
In an earlier publication , the microstructural features of Al - 20Si - 5Fe - 3Cu - 1Mg alloy processed by spray deposition were investigated in details [ 12 ] . 
The present work is aimed at understanding the effect of Mn addition on the microstructural evolution of spray - deposited Al - 20Si - 5Fe - 3Cu - 1Mg alloy . 
The investigation was conducted on three alloys with compositions as given in Table1 . 
The base alloy is of type Al ± 20Si ± 5Fe ± 3Cu ± 1Mg ( wt . % ) . 
The amount of Mn in the alloys A1 and A2 is 1 % and 3 % ( wt . % ) , respectively in order to elucidate the effect of Mn addition on the iron - containing compounds of spray - deposited Al - 20Si - 5Fe - 3Cu - 1Mg alloy . 
The spray - forming processing parameters are briefly summarized as follows . 
The melts were superheated to 820 ° C and atomized using nitrogen gas at 0 . 8 MPa pressure . 
The atomizer - substrate distance was 390 mm , and the delivery tube with the diameter of 3 . 1 mm was used . 
The spray - deposited specimens had a cylindrical disc shape with a diameter of about 120 mm . 
The microstructure of the spray - deposited specimens was revealed by etching with Keller ' s reagent . 
The polished and etched specimens were examined under a CAMBRIDGE S360 scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) ® tted with an energy - dispersive X - ray ( EDX ) analysis system . 
X - ray diffraction ( XRD ) analysis was carried out with a Japan Rigaku diffractometer using CuKa radiation ( 40 kV / 25 mA ) . 
The microstructures of the materials were also examined with a H - 800 transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) operating at a voltage of 120 kV . 
TEM disc - shaped specimens were prepared by using ion - beam thinning at a current of 0 . 5 mA and an inclination angle of 15 ° . 
Fig . 1 shows a typical SEM microstructure of the spray - deposited A0 alloy , which is composed of a - Al , Si ( dark gray ) and needle - like compound ( light gray ) . 
From Fig . 1 , one can see that most coarse Si particles are observed at the boundaries of needle - like compound , indicating that the compound surface may act as a nucleation site for these Si crystals . 
An EDX analysis shows that the needle - like compound contains Al , Si and Fe atoms , as shown in Fig . 2 . 
An XRD trace in Fig . 3 obtained from the spray - deposited A0 alloy shows that all the diffraction peaks could be analyzed as a mixture of fcc a - Al , diamond cubic Si , tetragonal δ - Al4FeSi2 and monoclinic β - Al5FeSi compounds . 
The XRD analysis revealed the coexistence of the metastable δ phase and equilibrium β phase in the spray - deposited A0 alloy . 
It is interesting to note that the increase in b phase was coupled with a decrease of the δ phase [ 13 ] . 
As the spray - deposited Al matrix does not contain excess solute atoms , the increase of β phase must have been transformed from the metastable δ phase through a peritectic reaction . 
Fig . 4 ( a ) and ( b ) represents the SEM microstructures of the spray - deposited A1 and A2 alloys , respectively . 
One can see that Mn addition leads to the variation in microstructure of the intermetallic compounds . 
With the addition of 1 wt . % Mn to the spray - deposited A0 alloy , the needle - like compounds were decreased ( Fig . 4a ) and the compounds were eliminated entirely from the final product when 3 wt . % Mn was added to the spray - deposited A0 alloy . 
One can also see from Fig . 4 ( b ) that a high volume fraction of particle - like compound was formed in the microstructure of the spray - deposited A2 alloy . 
An EDX analysis indicates that the particle - like compound contains Al , Si , Fe and Mn atoms , as shown in Fig . 5 . 
Fig . 6 represents the XRD traces with analyzed results , obtained from spray - deposited A1 and A2 alloys , respectively . 
In comparison with Fig . 3 , one can see that the diffraction peaks of δ and β phases in the spray - deposited A1 alloy were weaker than those in the spray - deposited A0 alloy . 
Meanwhile , the Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3 Si2 phase , which can be regarded as a solid solution of Fe in the Al15MnSi2 [ 14 ] , was detected in the spray - deposited A1 and A2 alloys . 
It shows that the needle - like compounds in the spraydeposited A0 alloy were partially replaced by the particle - like Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3 Si2 phase in the spray - deposited A1 alloy , and that the needle - like compounds were replaced entirely by the particle - like Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3 Si2 phase in the spray - deposited A2 alloy . 
TEM analysis continues to show that the particle - like compound in the spray - deposited A2 alloy is Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3 Si2 phase , as shown in Fig . 7 , which is in good agreement with the XRD results , as shown in Fig . 6 . 
The XRD results mentioned previously show that d and b phases are always present in the spray - deposited A0 and A1 alloys . 
According to the Al - Si - Fe ternary phase diagram [ 15 ] , the equilibrium solidification of Al - 20Si - 5Fe alloy starts with the formation of the δ phase at about 820 ° C , followed by the formation of the primary Si phase at below 700 ° C . 
At the temperature below 610 ° C , the formed δ phase transforms into the β phase . 
At about 576 ° C , the ternary eutecticum consisting of the a - Al , Si phase and β phase is formed . 
It is well known that the sequence of equilibrium solidification events should not be followed in spray - deposited hypereutectic Al - Si alloys . 
According to the SEM , EDX and XRD results mentioned above , we might assume that the solidification of the spray - deposited A0 alloy droplets occurs in the following sequence . 
In the beginning of solidification , metastable d phase is crystallized and then primary Si nucleates on the δ phase and grows , as shown in Fig . 1 . 
Finally , the remaining liquid solidified into an irregular ternary eutectic of a - Al , Si and δ phase . 
The reason for the formation of β phase is associated with the thermal condition of impinging droplets . 
The solidification process during spray forming occurs in two stages : gas atomization ( rapid cooling ) and droplet consolidation ( relatively slow cooling ) . 
In case of gas atomization , the δ phase is able to form within droplets to some extent before deposition . 
Upon droplet deposition , an abrupt fall in solidification rate occurs on the deposit layer . 
At this time , the δ phase originated from the droplets can be readily transferred into the stable β phase due to slow cooling effect and due to the fact that δ phase is extremely metastable . 
The crystallization behavior of iron - containing intermetallic compounds in 319 aluminum alloy has been well explained by Narayanan et al . [ 16 ] . 
Unlike the Mn - free Al15Fe3Si2 phase , the Mn - containing Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3 Si2 crystallizes below the liquidus but above the silicon eutectic . 
As a result we may assume that the Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 phase forms first and is followed by the formation of primary Si in the spray - deposited A1 and A2 alloy . 
The Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 phase generally has a dendritic morphology which appears as ' ' Chinese script ' ' in cast aluminum alloys . 
The reason why the Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 is particle - like in the spray - deposited A1 and A2 alloys is that the deformation and fracture experienced in the partially solidified droplets during deposition break the ' ' Chinese script ' ' Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 phase . 
This strengthens the nucleation kinetics of the Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 by increasing the density of nuclei in the top layer of spray - deposited A1 and A2 alloys . 
With the addition of 1 wt . % Mn to the spray - deposited A0 alloy , residual Fe in the spray - deposited A1 alloy can be formed d and b compounds after the Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 phase is crystallized . 
However , all of compounds in the spray - deposited A2 alloy were Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3 Si2 with the addition of 3 wt . % Mn to the spray - deposited A0 alloy . 
In this case , no residual Fe exists in the spray - deposited A2 alloy . 
Thus , needle - like compounds are avoided in the spray - deposited A2 alloy . 
From the results of XRD , SEM , EDX and TEM experiments mentioned previously , one can see that chemical neutralization of Fe with Mn is effective . 
The experimental results have shown that the presence of the needle - like compounds in the spray - deposited Al - 20Si - 5Fe - 3Cu - 1Mg alloy can be avoided on the condition that the Mn / Fe ratio is large than 0 . 6 , keeping the iron level constant at 5 wt . % . 
According to Mocellin [ 8 ] , the β phase has a detrimental influence on the properties when it is in the primary state . 
Its effect may be negligible or even beneficial when it is part of a eutectic . 
Thus , the mechanical properties ( particularly the high - temperature performance ) of spray - deposited Al - 20Si - 5Fe - 3Mn - 3Cu - 1Mg alloy are improved as a result of the needlelike Al - Si - Fe compounds are substituted by the particle - like Al - Si - Fe - Mn compound . 
The precipitation strengthening and mechanical properties of the spray - deposited Al - 20Si - 5Fe - 3Mn - 3Cu - 1Mg alloy will be presented in a separate article . 
The microstructure of spray - deposited Al - 20Si - 5Fe - 3Cu - 1Mg alloy is composed of the a - Al , Si and the needle - like compounds . 
The presence of Mn alters the characteristics of the iron - containing needle - like compounds to the particle - like Al15 ( Fe , Mn ) 3Si2 compound in the spray - deposited Al - 20Si - 5Fe - 3Cu - 1Mg alloy . 
With the addition of 3 wt . % Mn to the spray - deposited Al - 20Si - 5Fe - 3Cu - 1Mg alloy , the needle - like Al - Si - Fe compounds can be substituted by the particle - like Al - Si - Fe - Mn compound . 
Wear behavior of secondary processed spray formed Al - 28Si - 5Cu - 4Mg alloy 
In the present study Al - 28Si - 5Cu - 4Mg alloy has been spray formed and hot pressed for densification . 
Hot pressing refined the microstructure and reduced the porosity in the spray formed alloy from 10 to 1 % . 
The microstructure of spray formed and hot pressed alloy exhibited equiaxed grain morphology with fine and uniform distribution of both primary and eutectic Si with fine needles of Q - Al12Si7Mg4Fe intermetallics and Chinese script like θ Al2Cu precipitates in α - Al matrix . 
The size of Si particles ranged from 3 – 10 µ m . 
In contrast the microstructure of as - cast alloy consisted of coarse primary and eutectic Si , long needles of Q - Al - Si - Mg - Cu - Fe phase and bright grey θ - Al2Cu phase in the α - Al matrix . 
The size of primary Si varied from 30 – 250 µ m . 
The spray formed and hot pressed alloy exhibited a higher hardness compared to the as - cast alloy . 
The wear behavior of both the alloys , under dry sliding conditions , showed an increase in the wear rate with an increase in the load . 
However , the spray formed and hot pressed alloy exhibited maximum wear resistance and minimum coefficient of friction , while as - cast alloy exhibited minimum wear resistance and maximum coefficient of friction over the entire range of applied load . 
The high wear resistance and high hardness of spray formed and hot pressed alloy are explained in the light of its microstructural modifications induced during spray forming and subsequent hot pressing and also the topographical features of worn surfaces and morphology of debris particles . 
The chemical composition of Al - 28Si - 5Cu - 4Mg alloy is shown in Table 1 . 
The details of spray forming set up employed in the present study have been described elsewhere [ Raj08 ] . 
In brief , spray forming process employed an annular convergent - divergent nozzle to create a spray of melt . 
In each run 2 . 5 kg of alloy has been melted to a temperature of 1018 ° C in a resistance heating furnace . 
The molten metal is atomized by nitrogen ( N2 ) gas . The resultant spray is deposited over a Cu substrate resulting in a near net shaped preform . The process variables employed in spray forming are listed in Table 2 . 
Specimens of size 100 x 30 x 20 mm were cut from the preforms . 
The specimens were hot pressed at a pressure of 55 MPa and a temperature of 480 ° C for densification . The density of spray formed alloys was measured by using Archimedes principle as per ASTM : B962 – 08 . The percentage of porosity ( % P ) in the spray formed alloys was measured by using the actual density ( ρ ac ) and the theoretical density ( ρ th ) of the alloys using the relation , % P = [ 1 - ( ρ ac / ρ th ) ] x 100 . 
Samples were extracted from as - cast , as - spray formed and spray formed and hot pressed Al - 28Si - 5Cu - 4Mg alloys for microstructural examination . 
The samples were prepared by polishing using standard metallographic techniques of grinding on emery paper with 1 / 0 , 2 / 0 , 3 / 0 and 4 / 0 specifications . 
Final polishing was done on a wheel cloth using brasso and kerosene . 
The polished samples were etched with Keller ’ s reagent ( 1 % vol . hydrofluoric acid ( HF ) , 1 . 5 % vol . hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) , 2 . 5 % vol . nitric acid ( HNO3 ) and rest water ) . 
The microstructures of samples were examined under a ZEISS Optical Microscope and Scanning Electron Microscopy ( Model : S - 3400N Hitachi Model ) . 
Wear tests were conducted on as - cast and spray formed and hot pressed alloy specimens on a pin - on - disc wear testing machine ( Model : TR - 20 , DUCOM ) as per ASTM : G99 – 05 . 
The counterpart disc was made of quenched and tempered EN - 32 steel having a surface hardness of 65HRC . 
Wear specimens of size Ø 8 × 30 mm were machined out from both the alloys . 
The specimens were polished and then cleaned with acetone before conducting the test . 
The wear tests were conducted by varying the load from 10 – 70 N at a sliding velocity of 1 . 5 m / s and a sliding distance of 1025 m . 
The worn surfaces and the debris particles of both the alloys after wear testing were examined under Scanning Electron Microscopy . 
The hardness of the alloys was measured by Vickers Hardness Tester ( Mattoon ATK - 600 ) at an applied load of 300 g as per ASTM : E384 – 11e1 . 
Fig . 1 ( a ) shows the optical microstructure of as - cast Al - 28Mg - 5Cu - 4Mg alloy . 
The microstructure consists of coarse primary Si with eutectic network of Al - Si phase together with the intermetallic phases . 
Fig . 1 ( b ) shows the optical microstructure of as - spray formed alloy , which is composed of uniformly distributed primary Si particles , intermetallic secondary phases containing Cu and Mg in Al - matrix . 
The microstructure shows a significant difference to its as - cast counterpart . 
It is observed from the Fig . 1 ( b ) that the primary Si particulates and fine needle shaped intermetallics are evenly distributed in Al - matrix . 
The presence of fine , spherical and approximately 10 % of porosity has been observed in the as - spray formed alloy . 
Fig . 1 ( c ) shows the optical micrograph of spray formed and hot pressed alloy . 
It can be observed from the figure that there is a fragmentation of Si and brittle θ and Q intermetallics in the Al - matrix and porosity has been reduced to 1 % . 
The SEM micrograph of as - cast alloy shown in Fig . 2 ( a ) is mainly composed of polygonal block like Si , dark grey colored needles of Q - Al68Si13Mg8Cu6Fe4 phase and bright grey θ - Al2Cu phase in the form of Chinese script . 
The SEM micrograph of as - spray deposited alloy is shown in Fig . 2 ( b ) . 
The microstructure of alloy exhibited coexisting faceted primary Si particles and fine plates of complex intermetallic phases . 
The size of Si particles varied from 3 to 10 µ m compared to large particle size of 150 µ m in as - cast alloy . 
The various phases present are grey colored Si particulates as a major element , grey colored intermetallic Q - Al48Si29Mg18Fe4 phase and bright white phase of θ - Al2Cu . 
The solidification of as - cast Al - 28Si - 5Cu - 4Mg alloy , due to slow cooling rate and broad temperature interval between the liquidus and solidus of higher Si content in the pseudo binary section will cause castings with a coarse plate like Si , needle like Q and Chinese script like Al2Cu phases . 
In spray forming process , the solidification phenomena changes due to the effect of high cooling rate during the atomization stage and the unique microstructural evolution mechanism after deposition . 
As the cooling rate increases during atomization , the droplets experience a large under cooling prior to nucleation of primary Si phase leading to refinement . 
Simultaneously , reduced temperature suppresses the growth of these phases even after the deposition . 
Thus , large amount of fine and uniformly distributed Si and greater number of precipitates ( Al2Cu phase , Q phase ) are seen in the as - spray formed alloy . 
The dendritic as well as the Chinese script structures observed in the as - cast alloy are modified and it is difficult to discern the difference between primary Al2Cu and Q phases . 
Hot pressing of as - spray formed alloy led to a considerable reduction in porosity , grain recovery and recrystallization to a certain extent . 
The preheat treatment before compression process makes the microstructure more uniform . 
Secondly , hot deformation leads to micro structural refinement and solid - state phase transformation . 
The severe stress imposed by hot compression generates high density dislocations in the grains . 
Subsequently , the movement and arrangement of dislocations form a lot of small angle grain - boundaries , refining initial grains into several substructures . 
In addition to the refinement of grains , hot deformation also promotes homogeneous precipitation hardening of θ phase and Q phase which can pin the movement of dislocations to restrain grains coarsening during recrystallization effectively [ Est90 ] . 
The results of hardness measurement show that the hardness of spray formed and hot pressed alloy is ( 142 VHN ) higher than that observed in the as - cast alloy ( 82 VHN ) . 
The higher hardness of spray formed + hot pressed alloy can be atributed to the microstructrural refinement of θ - Al2Cu and Q phases owing to the rapid solidification effect and partial recrystallization , fragmentation of θ - Al2Cu and Q phases further and reduced porosity due to hot pressing . 
The hardness of the spray formed and hot pressed alloy is nearly 1 . 75 times higher than that of the as - cast alloy . 
The microstructural changes from as - cast to spray formed and hot pressed alloy could lower the stress concentration at the interface of Q phase and a - Al matrix . 
Therefore , the tendency to initiate subsurface cracks is reduced leading to an increased hardness in spray formed and hot pressed alloy [ Sha07 , Hua09 ] . 
Fig . 3 ( a ) shows the variation of wear rate with applied load and Fig . 3 ( b ) shows the variation of coefficient of friction with load for as - cast and spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu - 4Mg alloys at a sliding speed of 1 . 5 m / s and a sliding distance of 1025 m respectively . 
The wear rate increased as the load increased in both the alloys . 
It was observed that there is a remarkable difference in the wear rate , particularly at higher loads , in both the alloys . 
The wear rate of as - cast alloy is approximately 3 times higher than that of the spray formed and hot pressed alloy . 
The microstructural features like morphology , size and distribution of hard intermetallics ( Q - phase ) and θ - Al2Cu precipitates have a large influence on the dry sliding wear behavior of alloy [ Haq01 ] . 
The long needles of intermetallic Q - phase and coarse θ Al2Cu phase appear to have played an important role in aggravating the wear process in ascast alloy . 
The sharp edges of intermetallic Q - phase may have acted as crack nucleation sites resulting in a stress concentration that is more severe at the interface between the tip of needle - like intermetallic Q - phase and the Al - matrix [ Wan04 ] that led to the fracture of long needles of Q - phase resulting in a high wear rate in as - cast alloy . The spray formed and hot pressed alloy showed lower wear rate compared to the as - cast alloy . The reduction in porosity , recrystallization and fragmentation of Q - phase and Al2Cu phase , their uniform distribution in the matrix of spray formed and hot pressed alloy , decrease the stress concentration between the fine needles of Q - phase and the matrix and increase the strength of matrix due to fine dispersion of Al2Cu resulting in an improved wear resistance . 
At low loads , more time is available for the formation and growth of micro - welds , which increases the force needed to shear - off the micro - welds to keep the relative motion and this leads to an increase in wear resistance . 
An increase in the load results in the rise of the interface temperature that engenders oxidation and thermal softening of material . The brittle and discrete oxide film is harmful because it acts as a hard impurity or third body between mating surfaces [ Ana09 ] . 
The wear rate with normal load shows a linear relation up to the load of 30 N . 
Further increase in the load to 70 N shows an abrupt increase in wear rate indicating a change in the wear mechanism . 
At high loads , the thermal softening of the alloy in the sub surface region takes place leading to a large scale plastic deformation [ Moh96 ] . 
Under such conditions , metallic wear takes place . 
The remarkable observation in the present study is that the fine distribution of Q - phase and a good interfacial bonding at the interface with the matrix provided by the fine precipitates of θ - Al2Cu , allows for high temperature stability leading to a low wear rate in spray formed and hot pressed alloy compared to that of as - cat alloy . 
It can be observed that coefficient of friction is lowest for the spray formed and hot pressed alloy and highest for as - cast alloy however ; the variation of coefficient of friction with load is very small and can be assumed to be constant for both alloys over the entire range of load ( Fig . 3 ( b ) ) . 
The SEM micrographs of worn surface of Al - 28Si - 5Cu - 4Mg alloys at a load of 70 N are shown in Fig . 4 . 
The worn surface of as - cast alloy shown in Fig . 4 ( a ) consists of ploughing marks and a large number of pits indicating a high wear rate . The heavy damage may be due to the presence of long needles of Q - phase and coarse θ - Al2Cu phase and their uneven distribution in the alloy . 
It seems that the coarse phases are readily fractured and broken off during wear weakening the matrix leading to a high wear rate . 
In contrast the worn surface of spray formed and hot pressed alloy shown in Fig . 4 ( b ) consists of light scoring marks and shallow dimples in one or two regions clearly indicating a low wear rate . 
This may be due to the refinement in the microstructure where the Q - phase and θ - Al2Cu phase have been finely divided and uniformly distributed in the matrix . 
This fine dispersion provides strength to the matrix and the bonding between these phases and the matrix is strong enough to retain them to the matrix during wear leading to a low wear rate [ Wan04 ] . 
The SEM micrographs of wear debris of Al - 28Si - 5Cu - 4Mg alloys are shown in Fig . 5 . 
The wear debris of as - cast alloy is shown in Fig . 5 ( a ) and that of spray formed and hot pressed alloy is shown in Fig . 5 ( b ) . 
Close observation of the micrographs reveals that the size of debris particles of as - cast alloy is bigger than that of spray formed and hot pressed alloy . 
The as - cast alloy consists of large flakes and bigger debris particles where as spray formed and hot pressed alloy consists of smaller flakes and fine debris particles . 
The size of wear debris particle was found to be related to the applied load and the hardness of the material [ Ana10 ] . 
Since the hardness of spray formed and hot pressed alloy is higher than that of as - cast alloy , the size of its debris particles is smaller than that of as - cast alloy . 
The smaller size of the debris particles indicates that the wear rate of spray formed and hot pressed alloy is lower than that of as - cast alloy [ Esh11 ] . 
The following conclusions may be drawn from the present investigation on the spray forming and hot pressing of Al - 28Si - 5Cu - 4Mg alloy . The microstructure of spray formed and hot pressed alloy consists of fine and uniform distribution of both primary and eutectic Si with fine needles of Q - Al12Si7Mg4Fe intermetallics and Chinese script like θ - Al2Cu precipitates in the Al - matrix . Hot pressing has reduced the porosity from 10 to 1 % in spray formed alloy . The hardness of spray formed and hot pressed alloy is 142 VHN and that of as - cast alloy is 82 VHN . The wear resistance of spray formed and hot pressed alloy is higher than that of the as - cast alloy . The worn surface is less damaged and the debris particles are smaller in spray formed and hot pressed alloy compared to that in the as - cast alloy . 
Title : Effect of Cu and Mg on the wear properties of spray formed Al - 22Si alloy 
In the present study , the effect of Cu and Mg on the wear behavior of spray formed Al - 22Si alloy has been investigated and the same has been compared with that of its counterpart as - cast alloy . 
Al - 22Si and Al – 22Si – 4Cu – 1 . 7Mg alloys prepared by spray deposition process were hot pressed to reduce the porosity . 
The microstructures were examined by optical and scanning electron microscopes . 
The microstructure of spray formed Al - 22Si alloy is fine and homogeneous and primary silicon phase distributed in the aluminum matrix evenly are fine and faceted having a mean size of 12 µ m . 
The microstructure of spray formed Al – 22Si – 4Cu – 1 . 7Mg alloy exhibited equiaxed grain morphology with fine and uniform distribution of both primary and eutectic Si with fine Q - Al - Si - Mg - Cu phase and θ - Al2Cu precipitates dispersed evenly in α Al matrix . 
In contrast the microstructure of as - cast Al – 22Si alloy consisted of coarse plates of primary Si of size 350 µ m and eutectic Si needles . 
The as - cast Al – 22Si – 4Cu – 1 . 7Mg alloy consisted of coarse primary Si with Chinese script like θ - Al2Cu precipitates and needles of Q - AlSi - Mg - Cu phase in α - Al matrix . 
The wear study of both as - cast and spray formed and hot pressed alloys under an applied load of 10 to 50 N and sliding velocity of 0 . 4 to1 . 5 ms - 1 indicated two distinct regimes of mild and severe wear . In both the regimes , the spray - formed and hot pressed alloys consistently indicated a low wear rate compared to that of as - cast alloys . The high wear resistance of spray formed and hot pressed Al – 22Si and Al – 22Si – 4Cu – 1 . 7Mg alloys were explained in the light of their microstructural modifications induced during spray forming and subsequent hot pressing . 
The chemical composition of Al – 22Si and Al – 22Si – 4Cu – 1 . 7Mg alloys is shown in Table 1 . The details of spray forming set up employed in the present study have been described elsewhere [ Day13 ] . 
In brief , spray forming process employed an annular convergent - divergent nozzle to create a spray of the melt .

Wear tests were conducted on all the alloy specimens on a pin - on - disc wear testing machine ( Model : TR20 , DUCOM ) as per ASTM : G99 - 05 . 
The counterpart disc was made of quenched and tempered EN - 32 steel having a surface hardness of 65HRC . 
Wear specimens of size Ø 8 × 30 mm were machined out from both the alloys . 
The specimens were polished and then cleaned with acetone before conducting the wear test . 
The wear tests were conducted by varying load from 10 – 50 N at a sliding velocity of 1 . 5 ms - 1 and a sliding distance of 1025 m . 
Similarly the sliding velocity of the disc was varied from 0 . 4 to 1 . 4 ms - 1 at a constant applied load of 50 N . 
All the experiments were carried out under dry sliding conditions and data was recorded at room temperature . 
The worn surfaces of both the alloys after wear testing were examined under Scanning Electron Microscopy .

The Si particles are highly refined having a size varying from 2 – 25 μ m , Cu and Mg containing intermetallics are uniformly distributed in the Almatrix . 
The presence of fine , spherical porosity of 15 . 2 % has been observed in the spray formed alloy . 
Fig . 4 ( a ) shows the SEM / EDS micrograph of spray deposited Al - 22Si alloy . 
It can be seen from the micrograph that the alloy exhibited the primary Si particulates and fine eutectic Si phase which are uniformly distributed in Al - matrix . 
The EDS results of various phases present in the spray deposited alloy is shown in Table 5 . 
The SEM / EDS micrograph of spray deposited Al22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy is shown in the Fig . 4 ( b ) . 
The microstructure of alloy exhibited coexisting faceted primary Si particles and fine plates of complex intermetallic phases . 
The size of Si particles varied from 3 to 20 µ m compared to large particle size of 150 µ m in as - cast alloy . The various phases present are grey colored Si particulates as a major element , grey colored intermetallic Q - Al48Si29Mg18Fe4 phase and bright white phase of θ - Al2Cu . 
The EDS results of various phases present in the spray deposited alloy is shown in Table 6 . 
Fig . 5 shows the X - ray images of spray formed Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy . 
This reveals the presence of Si , Cu and Mg elements which are uniformaly distributed in the spray formed alloy and is well corroborated with EDS results . 
The optical microstructure of spray formed and hot pressed Al - 22Si alloy is shown in Fig . 6 ( a ) . 
This exhibits the fragmentation of primary Si particles , eutectic Si phase , significantly reduced porosity level of 5 . 4 % and increased volume fraction of Si phase . 
Fig . 6 ( b ) shows the optical micrograph of spray formed and hot pressed Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy . 
It can be observed from the Fig . 6 ( b ) that there is a fragmentation of Si and brittle θ and Q intermetallics and porosity has been reduced to 3 . 8 % . 
The solidification of as - cast Al - 22Si and Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloys , due to slow cooling rate and broad temperature interval between the liquidus and solidus of higher Si content composite in the pseudo binary section will cause castings with a coarse plate like Si , needle like Q and Chinese script like Al2Cu phases . 
In spray forming process , the solidification phenomena changes due to the effect of high cooling rate during the atomization stage and the unique microstructural evolution mechanism after deposition . 
The fine uniform distribution of primary Si particles and eutectic Si phase and equiaxed morphology of the α - Al phase are remarkable features of spray deposited hypereutectic Al - Si alloy . 
These features are due to the relatively high cooling rate ( 103 - 106 Ks - 1 ) associated with repeated deformation and extensive fragmentation of partially solidified droplets during the build - up of the deposit which could effectively alter the morphological stability of the Si phase [ Sri01 ] . 
As the cooling rate increases during atomization , the droplets experience a large undercooling prior to nucleation of primary Si phase leading to refinement . 
Simultaneously , reduced temperature suppresses the growth of these phases even after the deposition [ Gra95 ] . 
Thus , large amount of fine and uniformly distributed Si and greater number of precipitates ( Al2Cu phase , Q phase ) are seen in the spray formed Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy . 
The dendritic as well as the Chinese script structures observed in the as - cast alloys are modified and it is difficult to discern the difference between primary Al2Cu and Q phases . 
The porosity has been observed in the deposits and was uniformly distributed . 
The spherical morphology and non - connected distribution of the pores suggest that their formation occurred due to the incorporation of gas , a well - described phenomenon caused by an excessive presence of liquid during the spray formation [ Cai98 ] . 
Hot pressing of spray formed alloys led to a considerable reduction in porosity and recrystallization of microstructure to a certain extent . 
The preheating treatment before compression process can make the microstructure more uniform . 
Secondly , hot deformation leads to a microstructural refinement and a solid - state phase transformation . 
The severe stress imposed by hot compression generates high density dislocations in the grains . 
Subsequently , the movement and arrangement of dislocations form lot of small angle grain - boundaries , refining initial grains into several substructures . 
In addition to the refinement of grains , hot deformation also promotes homogeneous precipitation of hardening of θ and Q phases which can pin the movement of dislocations to restrain grains coarsening during recrystallization effectively [ Est90 ] . 
The results of hardness measurement of spray formed + hot pressed ( SF + HP ) Al - 22Si and Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloys are as shown in the Table 7 . 
It is observed from the results that a significant increase in the microhardness of SF + HP alloys takes place compared to as - cast alloys . The SF + HP Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy exhibits higher hardness compared to Al - 22Si alloy . The increase in the hardness of spray formed + hot pressed Al - 22Si alloy is due to the presence of fine and uniform distribution of Si particles in Al - matrix as well as reduction of porosity . 
It may be noted that an increase in the volume fraction of the Si particles will lead to higher constraint in the localized deformation of softer matrix under the application of indentation load . 
The fine primary Si and eutectic Si phases provide an appreciable impediment to plastic deformation caused by the indentation . 
The higher hardness of spray formed + hot pressed Al - 22Si - 4Cu1 . 7Mg alloy can be atributed to the presence of fine and uniform distribution of brittle intermetallic θ - Al2Cu and Q phases in addition to fine primary Si particles [ Sha07 , Hau09 ] . 
Variation in the wear rate of both the AC and SF + HP alloys as a function of applied load at constant sliding velocity of 1 . 5ms - 1 is shown in Fig . 7 . 
Wear rate of both as - cast and SF + HP alloys increases with increasing normal load . 
Comparative study of wear behavior of two alloys shows that SF + HP alloys are subjected to lower wear rate than as - cast alloys under identical sliding conditions . 
In the entire range of applied load , the SF + HP Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy exhibited best wear resistance . 
Fig . 8 shows the effect of sliding velocity on the wear rate of the alloys . 
It is worthwhile to note that the wear rate initially decreases with increasing sliding velocity . 
With further increase in the sliding velocity beyond the critical limit , the wear rate increases irrespective of alloy condition and composition . 
It is observed from the variation of wear rate with sliding velocity that the spray formed alloys show less wear rate than as - cast alloys . 
Minimum wear rate is observed in SF + HP Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy . 
Fig . 9 depicts the variation of coefficient of friction of Al - 22Si and Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloys . 
It can be seen that initially , the coefficient of friction decreased with increasing load and found to be constant in all the alloys with further increase in load . 
The spray formed and hot pressed alloys indicate lowest coefficient of friction , whereas the highest friction coefficients occurred in the as - cast alloys . 
The different wear characteristics of spray formed alloys are related to their microstructural features . 
The wear behavior of hypereutectic Al - Si alloys has been reported in several recent investigations [ Dhe06 , Cla79 , Pra87 , Sas92 , Raj12 ] . 
In general , the size and shape of Si particles and the nature of dispersion of second phase particles in the matrix have been observed to have a strong influence on the wear rate of a wide range of materials . 
In the present work , the spray - formed and hot pressed alloys exhibit an uniform distribution of fine Si particles and distribution of hard intermetallics ( Q - phase ) and θ - Al2Cu precipitates have a large influence on the dry sliding wear behavior of alloys [ Haq01 ] . These features of the spray formed alloy are attributed to strong bonds at the matrix - particle interface due to the decrease in the particle size and the consequent microstructural stability of the alloy under a range of applied loads and sliding velocities . 
The block like Si particles , long needles of intermetallic Q - phase and coarse θ - Al2Cu phase appear to have played an important role in aggravating the wear process in as - cast alloy . 
The sharp edges of Si particles and intermetallic Q - phase may have acted as crack nucleation sites resulting in a stress concentration that is more severe at the interface between the tip of needle - like intermetallic Q - phase and the Al – matrix that led to the fracture of long needles of Q - phase resulting in a high wear rate in ascast alloy . 
The reduction in porosity , recrystallization and fragmentation of Q - phase and Al2Cu phase , their uniform distribution in the matrix of spray formed and hot pressed alloy , decrease the stress concentration between the fine needles of Q - phase and the matrix and increase the strength of matrix due to fine dispersion of Al2Cu , resulting in an improved wear resistance . 
At low loads , more time is available for the formation and growth of micro - welds , which increases the force needed to shear - off the micro - welds to keep the relative motion and this leads to an increase in wear resistance . 
An increase in the load results in the rise of the interface temperature that engenders oxidation and thermal softening of material . 
The brittle and discrete oxide film is harmful because it acts as a hard impurity or third body between mating surfaces [ Ana09 ] . 
The wear rate with normal load shows a linear relation up to the load of 40 N . 
Further increase in the load to 50 N shows an abrupt increase in wear rate indicating a change in the wear mechanism . 
At high loads , the thermal softening of the alloy in the sub surface region takes place leading to a large scale plastic deformation [ Moh96 ] . 
Under such conditions , metallic wear takes place . 
The remarkable observation in the present study is that the fine distribution of Si , intermetallic phases and good interfacial bonding at the interface with the matrix provided by the fine precipitates of θ - Al2Cu , allows for high temperature stability leading to a low wear rate in SF + HP Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy compared to SF + HP Al - 22Si alloy . 
The dispersoids of intermetallics phase in Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy possess higher hardness compared to that of eutectic Si phase in Al - 22Si alloy . 
The low melting constituent of eutectic Si is smeared out on mating surfaces at an early stage . 
This effect arises due to small interparticle spacings of dispersoids in spray - formed Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy . 
Consequently , a thin oxide layer is developed on the surface of wear test specimen which protects the materials from further wear . 
The low wear rate of SF + HP Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy justifies this mechanism . 
However , the stability of the oxide layer on the specimen surface depends on applied load and sliding velocity of the mating surfaces . 
The experimental result indicates that the stability regime of the oxidation film is extended to higher load and sliding velocity in the mild wear regime of the SF + HP alloys . 
However , as the sliding velocity is further increased , instability arises in the continuity of the oxidation layer . 
This is indicated by a significantly high wear rate of the material with further increase in the sliding velocity . 
Still in this severe wear regime , the SF + HP alloys , owing to the uniformly distributed Si and small inter particle spacing of its fine Si particles and intermetallics , continues to provide a relatively low wear rate compared to the as - cast alloys . 
Fig . 10 ( a ) shows the worn surfaces of as - cast Al - 22Si alloy . 
The surface is characterized by grooves running from one end to the other end of the surface . 
Large and heavy scoring marks with dimples are present on the surface . 
The worn tracks and surface damages like microgrooves , craters and abrasive scoring marks were also clearly observable . 
Detailed examination of the wear tracks revealed features associated with abrasive and delamination mechanism . 
The abrasive component of the wear mechanism is pointed out by the plough grooves inside the wear tracks due to the harder silicon particles scratching over the softer ( pin ) surface . 
Additionally , the delamination wear component can be concluded from the cracks and shallow craters , which are seen at the worn surface . 
Some large dimples can also be seen on the worn surface of the alloy , it indicates that block - like primary Si phases were fractured and broken off during wear . 
Fig . 10 ( b ) shows the worn surface of SF + HP Al - 22Si alloy . 
The grooves depicted on the worn surface are shallow and uniform . 
The surface clearly shows a smooth and fine scoring marks and without any pits and dimples that obviously leads to a low wear rate . 
The SEM micrographs of worn surfaces of Al - 22Si - 4Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloys are shown in Fig . 11 . 
The worn surface of as - cast alloy shown in Fig . 11 ( a ) consists of ploughing marks and a large number of pits indicating a high wear rate . 
The heavy damage may be due to the presence of long needles of Q - phase and coarse θ - Al2Cu phase and their uneven distribution in the alloy . 
It seems that the coarse phases are readily fractured and broken off during wear weakening the matrix leading to a high wear rate . 
In contrast , the worn surface of spray formed + hot pressed alloy shown in Fig . 11 ( b ) consists of light scoring marks and shallow dimples in one or two regions clearly indicating a low wear rate . 
This may be due to the refinement in the microstructure where the Q - phase and θ - Al2Cu phase have been finely divided and uniformly distributed in the matrix . 
This fine dispersion provides strength to the matrix and the bonding between these phases and the matrix is strong enough to retain them to the matrix during wear leading to a low wear rate [ Wan04 ] . 
Spray forming is effective in refining the microstructures of Al - 22Si and Al - 22Si - 5Cu1 . 7Mg alloys . 
The spray deposited Al - 22Si alloys exhibited fine and uniform distribution of primary Si and eutectic Si phases and equiaxial morphology of α - Al phase . 
The microstructure of spray formed Al - 22Si - 5Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy exhibited fine and uniform distribution of both primary and eutectic Si with small needles of Q - intermetallics and θ - Al2Cu precipitates spread around the boundaries and junctions of grains in α - Al matrix . 
Hot pressing of spray - formed alloys leads to reduction in porosity , grain recovery and recrystallization to certain extent . 
The spray formed and hot pressed alloys show maximum hardness compared to as - cast alloys . 
The spray formed and hot pressed Al - 22Si - 5Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy showed maximum hardness compared to other alloys . 
Wear rate of spray formed Al - 22Si - 5Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy is lower than that of Al - 22Si alloy under identical sliding conditions . 
This is because of the presence of fine intermetallics in the former alloy . 
The wear rate of both as - cast and spray formed alloys initially decreases with increase in sliding speed up to a critical speed and then increases but the wear rate is high for as - cast Al - 22Si alloy and low for spray formed and hot pressed Al - 22Si - 5Cu - 1 . 7Mg alloy . 
Title : Microstructural characterisation of spray formed Si – 30Al for thermal management applications 
This paper presents a study of the microstructure of a spray formed Si – 30 wt . % Al alloy used in electronic packaging applications . 
The microstructure consisted of ~ 5 μ m equiaxed primary Si grains and a coarse grained Al - rich phase with occasional regions of ~ 10 μ m equiaxed Al - rich grains interpenetrating the Si network with no evidence of a lamellar Al – Si eutectic . 
This unusual microstructure arose because of the particular solidi ﬁ cation conditions during and immediately after the spray forming process and the large alloy freezing range . 
The increasing power and density of modern avionic and satellite electronics demands e ffi cient heat dissipation to prevent the premature failure of semiconductor devices [ 1 ] . 
Failure rates increase dramatically as device temperature increases : typically for every 10 ℃ temperature rise , the lifetime of a GaAs or Si semiconductor device is reduced by a factor of three [ 2 ] . 
Heat dissipation and cooling is usually achieved by the use of heat sinks , heat spreaders and packaging materials [ 3 ] . 
Ideal thermal management materials have a coe ffi cient of thermal expansion ( CTE ) of 7 – 9x10 - ^ 6 ℃ - ^ 1 closely matched to GaAs or Si , high thermal conductivity of > 100 W / m K and a low density of < 3 g cm - ^ 3 , especially for transport applications . 
Hypereutectic Al - high Si alloys possess a combination of physical properties that make them attractive for thermal management applications , including the required relatively high thermal conductivity , low density , and a linear variation in CTE with temperature [ 4 , 5 ] . 
The proportion of Al to Si in these alloys determines the alloy CTE and can be tailored in the range 7 – 17x10 - ^ 6 ℃ - ^ 1 to speci ﬁ c thermal management applications , such as Al2O3 circuit boards or GaAs semiconductor devices [ 6 ] . 
Further advantages include : high speci ﬁ c sti ff ness , laser and electron beam weldability , platability with Au or Cu , and good RF screening [ 2 ] . 
To prevent cracking and poor integrity found in conventionally cast Al - high Si alloys , spray forming [ 7 ] has been developed for the manufacture of bulk Si – Al alloys with Si concentrations up to 70 wt . % . 
This paper presents a detailed study of the microstructure of a spray formed Si – 30 wt . % Al alloy , showing for the ﬁ rst time key microstructural features in both the primary Si and secondary Al - rich phases . 
A 26 kg Si – 30 wt . % Al billet ( all compositions in wt . % ) , termed SFSi30Al , was manufactured by spray forming at Sandvik - Osprey Metals Ltd . 
An Al – 30Si master alloy was induction melted , pure polycrystalline Si was added , and at ~ 1450 ℃ ( 200 ℃ superheat ) , the melt was poured into a conical tundish which fed a ceramic melt delivery nozzle . 
The melt was atomised using a two stage , scanning atomiser operating with N2 gas . 
The trajectory of the resulting droplets comprising the spray was intercepted by a ceramic collector plate manipulated within the spray cone to build - up progressively a coherent billet [ 6 , 7 ] . 
Full manufacturing details are proprietary . 
Once spraying was complete , the still semi - solid billet was removed from the spray chamber , insulated and then force cooled from the base of the billet [ 5 ] to concentrate any shrinkage porosity in the top of the billet , which was then scalped . 
The billet was hot isostatically pressed ( HIPed ) close to the binary Al – Si eutectic temperature of 577 ℃ to reduce any residual porosity to < 0 . 1 vol . % . 
The resulting microstructure was investigated using a combination of : ( i ) optical microscopy ; ( ii ) electron probe microanalysis ( EPMA ) in a JEOL JXA 8800 superprobe ; ( iii ) electron backscatter di ff raction ( EBSD ) with simultaneous energy dispersive X - ray spectroscopy ( EDS ) in a JEOL 6500 ﬁ eld emission gun - scanning electron microscope ; and ( iv ) X - ray di ff raction ( XRD ) tilting experiments using a Nonius powder di ff raction system with an Inel curved position sensitive detector , Cu Ka1 radiation and a Ge h1 1 1i monochromator . 
In the XRD studies , the sample was rotated with the angle relative to the beam ﬁ xed and ﬁ ve data sets collected with the sample tilted at approximately 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 . 
For EBSD studies , the sample was tilted to 70 . 5 and analysed with a high beam current ( typically 100 nA ) using an accelerating voltage of 20 keV at a working distance of ~ 15 mm . 
Proprietary EDAX TSL OIM data acquisition and analysis software was used and simultaneously acquired EDS information allowed the data from the Al and Si - rich phases to be partitioned and investigated separately . 
Figure 1 shows optical micrographs of spray formed and HIPed Si – 30Al ( SFSi30Al ) and an as - cast Si – 30Al alloy for comparison . 
Figure 1 ( a ) shows the microstructure of SFSi30Al consisted of a continuous network of globular primary Si and an interpenetrating secondary ‘ ductilising ’ Al - rich phase , in contrast to the much larger acicular primary phase and coarse ﬂ ake eutectic in the as - cast microstructure in Figure 1 ( b ) . 
The spray formed material exhibited no Al – Si lamellar eutectic in inter - Si regions , and instead these regions consisted of a single Al - rich phase only , with a typical Si concentration of ~ 0 . 2 % and impurity concentrations for Fe , Cu , Ti , Zr of 0 . 2 % , 0 . 03 % , 0 . 04 % , and 0 . 02 % , respectively as determined by EPMA . 
Interspersed through this Al - rich phase were occasional intermetallic particles that EPMA showed to contain predominantly either Al – Fe – Si or Si – Ti – Zr . 
Figure 2 ( a ) shows an EBSD orientation map for Si only with the surface of the sample parallel to the billet axial direction and where Si - rich and Al - rich phases have been identi ﬁ ed and partitioned on the basis of simultaneously acquired EDS data . 
The Si grains were equiaxed with a mean grain size of ~ 5 μ m and contained approximately 25 % by number of coherent R3 60  / h1 1 1i twin boundaries . 
The corresponding { 0 0 1 } pole ﬁ gure ( PF ) for Si shown in Figure 2 ( b ) indicated no preferred orientation . 
Figure 3 shows a lower magni ﬁ cation EBSD orientation map of a di ff erent area for the Al - rich phase only . The Al - rich phase consisted of 250 – 300 lm regions containing grains with a narrow spread of crystallographic orientations . 
Figure 3 ( b ) and ( c ) show the corresponding { 0 0 1 } PF and inverse pole ﬁ gures ( IPF ) respectively indicating that the h0 0 1i direction was aligned approximately with the spray formed billet axis to within 15 . Although this ﬁ nding suggests that the Al - rich grains grew with a preferred h0 0 1i direction through the preexisting Si , other regions of the billet showed similarly sized regions in which the Al - rich grain < 1 1 0 > and h1 1 1i directions were approximately normal to the billet axial direction . 
Figure 3 ( a ) also shows smaller isolated regions of Al - rich grains , highlighted with circles , in which there was an Al - rich equiaxed grain size of ~ 10 μ m . 
As a complement to the EBSD investigations of any preferred directions in the Al - rich phase , Figure 4 shows tilting XRD experiment traces for SFSi30Al sectioned normal to the billet axial direction , at approximately half the billet height at the mid - radius position . 
The sample was tilted to bring grains to and away from the Bragg condition , allowing any crystallographic directionality to be identi ﬁ ed . 
Figure 4 shows that Al and Si phase peak intensities varied with tilt angle , indicating some preferred orientations . 
The microstructure of cast , unmodi ﬁ ed Si – 30Al consisted of coarse primary Si and inter - Si Al – Si lamellar eutectic . 
In SFSi30Al the primary Si is equiaxed and substantially re ﬁ ned with inter - Si distances ~ 30 μ m and the lamellar eutectic is suppressed . 
Insulation of the semi - solid billet immediately after spray forming leads to thermal equilibration of the billet to ~ 700 ℃ that must involve partial re - melting . 
At this temperature the billet comprises ~ 40 wt . % liquid at a composition of Al – 22 % Si [ 8 ] distributed throughout the solid primary Si network . 
Because the billet then remains insulated and cools very slowly , and there is a very high number density of Si grains arising from earlier nucleation of primary Si in the myriad of impinging droplets , the remaining Al – Si liquid solidi ﬁ es with a relatively low growth velocity V . This low V leads to the fully divorced eutectic , either because when the eutectic temperature is reached , the expected eutectic lamellar spacing k approaches the re ﬁ ned inter - Si distances of ~ 30 μ m [ 9 ] , or the facetted / non facetted solid – liquid front becomes unstable due to low V and large k [ 10 ] . 
This similarity of length scales of the stable eutectic spacing for eutectic growth at low V and the inter - Si spacing leads to Si atoms attaching to the pre - existing Si network or to the nucleation of new grains at the solid – liquid interface to act as growth sites for Si rejected from the liquid . 
The microstructures in this study suggest the former mechanism . In consequence , the residual liquid ﬁ nally solidi ﬁ ed as essentially pure a - Al containing only impurity elements in solid - solution as revealed by EPMA , and the resulting inter - Si regions are free of lamellar eutectic as reported previously for sprayformed hypoeutectic [ 12 ] and hypereutectic Al – Si alloys [ 13 , 14 ] . In order to con ﬁ rm that the similarity of the length scale of the likely eutectic spacing k at low V and the primary Si spacing was involved in the observed divorced eutectic , samples of SFSi30Al were re - heated to 700 ℃ for 1 h and then : ( a ) furnace cooled to simulate insulated post - spray cooling of the billet – low V ; ( b ) air cooled – intermediate V and ( c ) water quenched – high V , and the resulting microstructures are shown in Figure 5 ( a ) – ( c ) , respectively . 
Similarly to the as - sprayed material in Figure 1 ( a ) , the furnace cooled material in Figure 5 ( a ) had no Al – Si eutectic ; whereas the air cooled material in Figure 5 ( b ) showed ﬂ ake - like eutectic Si formation ; and the quenched sample in Figure 5 ( c ) had a very ﬁ ne ﬁ brous eutectic Si , consistent with conventional Al – Si eutectic solidi ﬁ cation [ 15 ] . 
Whereas the primary Si grain size is ~ 5 μ m , the Al - rich regions are much coarser with a length scale of 250 – 300 μ m . 
The coarser Al - rich grains can be attributed to ( a ) a much lower number density of e ffi cient a - Al nucleants in comparison with that population available from in - ﬂ ight nucleation for primary Si , and ( b ) a di ff usion - controlled coarsening constant for a - Al of ~ 10 - ^ 16 m ^ 3 s - ^ 1 that is three orders of magnitude larger than that of primary Si [ 16 – 18 ] . 
EBSD initially suggested that the Si grains were crystallographically random , however XRD tilting experiments in Figure 4 revealed the Si ( 1 1 1 ) intensity was weak relative to the other Si peaks – in a random arrangement the Si ( 1 1 1 ) peak intensity should be approximately twice that of Si ( 2 2 0 ) [ 19 ] . 
Figure 6 ( a ) shows the Si IPF obtained using EBSD from a 1750 μ m x 750 μ m area of the XRD sample corresponding to ~ 14 , 000 grains where the contours indicate the levels of crystallographic alignment . 
There is a weak peak in pole density of 1 . 16x random close to the < 1 1 2 > direction ( one of the directions normal to < 1 1 1 > ) . 
The EBSD IPF from a sample sectioned in the billet radial direction in Figure 6 ( b ) from ~ 10 , 000 grains showed a peak in pole density of 1 . 36x random close to the < 1 1 1 > orientation . 
The Si network is formed predominantly during spray forming rather than during post - spray cooling and the preferred Si < 1 1 1 > radial orientation results from Si < 1 1 1 > radial growth because radial heat ﬂ ow is dominant at the half height , midradius location where the atomising gas force cools the billet sides . 
Further growth of Si during post - spray cooling retains this orientation . 
The EBSD orientation map in Figure 3 showed a large area of Al - rich grains with a near h0 0 1i growth orientation in the billet axial direction , apparently undisturbed by the Si network though which it penetrates . 
Recognising that the Al - rich phase solidi ﬁ ed long after spray forming is complete , this orientation might be that expected as cooling from the billet base caused predominantly by axial heat ﬂ ow and < 0 0 1 > is the preferred growth direction for cubic metals . 
However , further EBSD investigations revealed that these large regions have a range of crystallographic directions and the XRD traces in Figure 4 indicated especially intense Al ( 1 1 1 ) peaks at certain tilt angles . 
EBSD investigation of a 1750 μ m x 750 μ m area of this same XRD sample con ﬁ rmed a ~ 250 μ m region oriented near to < 1 1 1 > . The occasional regions of ﬁ ne equiaxed Al grains shown in Figure 3 ( a ) are formed when either the liquid in these regions becomes isolated from the larger growing Al grains , or local compositional and undercooling conditions favour heterogeneous nucleation of new Al grains . 
A modi ﬁ ed spray forming process route has been developed for Si – Al alloys and produces a 5 μ m , equiaxed , weakly non - random oriented primary Si grain structure interpenetrated by a much coarser 250 – 300 μ m Al - rich phase containing grains with a narrow spread of orientations of ~ 15 , as well as much ﬁ ner areas with equiaxed grains at the scale of ~ 10 μ m . 
The conventional Al – Si lamellar eutectic structure was suppressed in favour of a fully divorced eutectic because of : ( i ) the myriad of solid droplets and particles from the spray process provided a high number density of Si nucleation sites and resulted in inter - Si distances < 30 μ m ; ( ii ) turbulent deposition surface conditions leading to solute sweeping and physical disruption of the solidi ﬁ cation front during spray forming ; and ( iii ) slow , post - spray solidi ﬁ cation conditions due to billet insulation , the large alloy freezing range and the relatively high latent heat associated with Si . 
Re - heating experiments supported the hypothesis that the fully divorced eutectic structure arose from a combination of the very slow cooling rate and the re ﬁ ned microstructural scale of the primary Si . 
title : Effect of copper and iron on the wear properties of spray formed Al – 28Si alloy 
In the present study the effect of copper ( Cu ) and iron ( Fe ) on the wear behavior of spray formed Al – 28Si alloy has been investigated . 
The spray formed Al – 28Si alloy exhibited equiaxed grain morphology with ﬁ ne and uniform distribution of Si particles in Al matrix and spray formed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy exhibited similar morphology with small needles of β - Al4FeSi intermetallics and globular shaped θ - Al2Cu precipitates spread along the boundaries and junctions of grains . 
Hot pressing has considerably reduced the porosity in spray formed alloys . On the contrary the microstructure of as - cast Al – 28Si alloy consisted of coarse primary and eutectic Si unevenly distributed in Al matrix and that of as - cast Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy consisted of coarse Si particles , long needles of β - Al4FeSi2 and θ - Al2Cu phases in Al matrix . Spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy exhibited higher value of hardness compared to the other alloys . 
The wear behavior of these alloys under dry sliding conditions showed that the spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy exhibited maximum wear resistance and minimum coef ﬁ cient of friction , while as - cast Al – 28Si alloy showed minimum wear resistance and maximum coef ﬁ cient of friction over the entire range of loads . 
The high wear resistance of spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy is explained in light of its microstructural modi ﬁ cations induced during spray forming and the topography of worn surfaces . 
The chemical composition of Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys is shown in Table 1 . The details of spray forming set up employed in the present study have been described elsewhere [ 9 ] . In brief , spray forming process employed an annular convergent – divergent nozzle to create a spray of melt . 
In each run 2 . 5 kg of alloy has been melted to a temperature of 800 ° C in a resistance heating furnace . 
The molten metal is atomized by a free fall atomizer using nitrogen ( N2 ) gas . 
The resultant spray is deposited over a Cu substrate resulting in a near net shaped preform . 
The process variables employed for producing the preforms are listed in Table 2 . Specimens of size 100 × 30 × 20 mm were cut from the preforms . The specimens were hot pressed at a pressure of 55 MPa and a temperature of 480 ° C for densi ﬁ cation . 
The density of spray formed alloys was measured by using Archimedes principle as per ASTM : B962 - 08 . 
The percentage of porosity ( % P ) in the spray formed alloys was measured by using the actual density ( ρ ac ) and the theoretical density ( ρ th ) of the alloys using the relation , % P = [ 1 - ( ρ ac / ρ th ) ] × 100 . 
Samples were extracted from as - cast , as - spray formed and spray formed + hot pressed Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys for microstructural examination . 
The samples were prepared by polishing using standard metallographic techniques of grinding on emery paper with 1 / 0 , 2 / 0 , 3 / 0 and 4 / 0 speci ﬁ cations . 
Final polishing was done on a wheel cloth using brasso and kerosene . 
The polished samples were etched with Keller ’ s reagent ( 1 % vol . hydro ﬂ uoric acid ( HF ) , 1 . 5 % vol . hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) , 2 . 5 % vol . nitric acid ( HNO3 ) and rest water ) . 
The microstructures of samples were examined under a ZEISS Optical Microscope and Scanning Electron Microscopy ( Model : S - 3400N Hitachi Model ) . 
Wear tests were conducted on all the alloy specimens on a pinon - disk wear testing machine ( Model : TR - 20 , DUCOM ) as per ASTM : G99 - 05 . 
The counterpart disk was made of quenched and tempered EN - 32 steel having a surface hardness of 65HRC . 
Wear specimens of size Ø 8 × 30 mm were machined out from all the alloys . 
The specimens were polished and then cleaned with acetone before conducting the test . 
The wear tests were conducted by varying the load from 10 to 70 N at a sliding velocity of 1 . 5 m / s and a sliding distance of 1025 m . 
The worn surfaces of wear specimens were examined under Scanning Electron Microscopy . 
The hardness of the alloys was measured by Vickers Hardness Tester ( Mattoon ATK - 600 ) at an applied load of 300 g as per ASTM : E384 - 11e1 . 
Fig . 1a shows the microstructure of as - cast ( AC ) Al – 28Si alloy . 
It consists of primary and eutectic Si phases in the α - Al matrix . 
The primary Si particles exhibited a plate like morphology with a size varying from 75 to 350 μ m , while eutectic phase comprises of Si needles . Fig . 1b depicts the microstructure of as - spray formed ( SF ) Al – 28Si alloy . 
The microstructure consists of an equiaxed , nearly spheroidized grain morphology of α - Al matrix . 
The Si particles are very much re ﬁ ned having a size varying from 2 to 15 μ m , and are uniformly distributed in the Al – matrix . 
A porosity of 14 % was observed in the as - spray formed alloy . 
An equiaxed , homogeneous , and uniform distribution of primary Si phase and modi ﬁ ed eutectic phase in Al – matrix of as - spray formed alloy can be obtained due to abundant nucleation of the melt due to rapid cooling in the ﬂ ight and on deposition . 
The semi solid droplets are fractured due to inter particle collision in the spray during ﬂ ight and upon impinging on a substrate . 
Also due to remelting of the solid component of the spray in the top surface region of the deposit effectively break the Si particles that are formed prior to the deposition stage [ 10 , 11 ] . 
The presence of such Si phase leads to an increase in the density of nuclei in the top layer of the as - spray formed alloy [ 12 ] . The microstructure of spray formed and hot pressed alloy shown in Fig . 1c exhibited a ﬁ ner matrix , fragmentation of Si phase , lower porosity of 7 % and enhanced density of the alloy . The acicular eutectic structure in the as - cast alloy seems to be at variance with short and blunted structure in the corresponding as - spray formed alloy ( Fig . 1b ) . 
The optical microstructure of as - cast Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy is shown in Fig . 2 . 
A relatively slow cooling rate associated with casting process develops coarse microstructural features of the alloy . The microstructure consists of block like grey primary Si particles and ternary β - Al4FeSi2 intermetallic sharp edged white rod / needles having a length ranging from 150 to 250 μ m and θ - Al2Cu phase in Al matrix . 
The Energy Dispersive X - ray ( EDX ) spectra of various phases present in the microstructure as indicated by the points in Fig . 2 are shown in Fig . 3 . 
The various phases are α - Al ( point 1 ) , primary Si ( point 2 ) , θ - Al2Cu ( point 3 ) and β - Al4FeSi2 ( point 4 ) . 
The β - phase is naturally a hard and brittle precipitate with a needle form , which usually acts as a stress raiser and interferes with liquid ﬂ owing in the interdendritic channels during solidi ﬁ cation [ 13 ] . 
Cu was found to exist mainly in the interdendritic Al2Cu phase seen around the Al4FeSi2 phase as Chinese script . 
Fig . 4a shows the microstructure of as - spray formed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy . 
It consists of uniformly distributed spherical shaped Si particles having an estimated mean size of 10 μ m in the α - Al matrix . In addition , no banded microstructure was observed in this alloy . The spherical morphology and non - connected distribution of pores have been observed in the as - spray formed alloy . 
Approximately 15 % porosity was found which suggests that the formation of pores occurred due to the incorporation of included gas , a well described phenomenon caused by an excessive presence of liquid during the spray generation [ 14 ] . 
The EDX spectra of various phases present in the microstructure as indicated by the points in Fig . 4a are shown in Fig . 5 . 
The various phases are α - Al ( point 1 ) , θ - Al2Cu ( point 2 ) , β - Al4FeSi ( point 3 ) and primary Si ( point 4 ) . The primary Si particles are uniformly distributed in the a - Al matrix . 
The bright phase could be identi ﬁ ed as θ - Al2Cu precipitates with globular morphology around very small needle type intermetallics with β - Al4FeSi . After hot pressing , the alloy showed partially re - crystallized grains together with elongated grains and a strong reduction in porosity to 4 % ( Fig . 4b ) . 
The primary Si particles are further fragmented in to smaller particles and are distributed uniformly in the Al matrix . 
The results of hardness measurement are shown in Table 3 . 
It is observed that the hardness of the spray formed alloys are higher than that of as - cast alloys . 
Also the hardness of Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe spray formed alloys are higher than that of Al – 28Si spray formed alloys . 
The higher hardness of as - spray formed Al – 28Si alloy can be attributed to the microstructural re ﬁ nement in primary Si phase owing to the rapid solidi ﬁ cation effect . 
In case of as - spray formed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy , apart from the re ﬁ nement of primary Si , the re ﬁ nement of Al4FeSi and Al2Cu phases have imparted a higher hardness to the alloy . 
A further increase in the hardness was observed in the spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si alloy due to the partial recrystallization , fragmentation and redistribution of primary Si phase in α - Al matrix and reduced porosity . 
In spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy apart from the re ﬁ nement of primary Si and reduced porosity , the fragmentation and redistribution of secondary phases ( β - Al4FeSi and θ - Al2Cu ) further increased the hardness of the alloy . 
The microstructural changes from as - cast to spray formed and hot pressed alloys , could lower the stress concentration at the interface of the Al4FeSi particles and α - Al matrix . Therefore , the tendency to initiate the subsurface cracks is reduced resulting in a higher hardness [ 15 ] . 
The wear characteristics of Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys for a range of applied load at a sliding velocity of 1 . 5 m / s and a sliding distance of 1025 m are shown in Fig . 6a . 
The load is varied from 10 to 70 N . 
It is observed from the Fig . 6a that the wear rate is increasing with increase in the load for all the alloys irrespective of the alloy processing condition . 
In the entire range of applied load , among both the alloy compositions the spray formed + hot pressed ( SF + HP ) alloys showed better wear resistance than the as - cast alloys . 
Comparative study of wear behavior of binary and quaternary alloy compositions revealed that the spray formed + hot pressed ( SF + HP ) Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy has got better wear resistance than that of spray formed + hot pressed ( SF + HP ) Al – 28Si alloy under identical sliding conditions . 
The wear resistance is highest for spray formed + hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy and lowest for as - cast Al – 28Si alloy . 
Obviously the size of primary Si has a great in ﬂ uence on the wear rate of these alloys . 
During the wear tests , the coarse Si phases fractured more frequently than the ﬁ ne Si phase [ 16 ] . 
As the load increases , the shear stress in the alloy increases which in turn increases the amount of fracture in Si phase and the deformation of the matrix in the surrounding area of Si . The stress concentration resulting from such deformation may critically depend on the size of Si particles and will be more severe at the interface between coarse Si particles and the matrix compared to that between ﬁ ne Si particles and the matrix . 
This is observed in the present study where the coarse Si phases fractured readily thereby decreasing the wear resistance of the as - cast alloys . 
Spray forming has re ﬁ ned the primary and eutectic Si into ﬁ ne particulates which are distributed uniformly in the α - Al matrix . 
In case of as - spray formed alloys the wear rates are little higher than that observed in spray formed + hot pressed alloys . 
The reason may be due to the presence of pores in the former alloys . 
Among the alloy compositions , the wear resistance of Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys is higher than that of Al – 28Si alloys . 
The addition of alloying elements Cu and Fe to Al – 28Si has improved the wear resistance of Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys . 
The wear resistance of quaternary as - cast alloy is higher than that of binary as - cast alloy . 
This is because of the reason that the quaternary alloy consists of β - Al4FeSi2 and θ - Al2Cu phases . The β - phase is basically hard and increases the hardness of the alloy there by increasing the wear resistance [ 14 ] . 
The θ - phase provides strengthening effect to α - Al matrix that reduces the chances of peeling off of coarse Si plates from the matrix there by improving the wear resistance [ 15 ] . 
The wear resistance of spray formed and hot pressed quaternary alloy is higher than that of as - cast quaternary alloy . 
This is due to the re ﬁ nement of long needles of β - Al4FeSi2 phase and Chinese script like θ - Al2Cu phase in to ﬁ ne needles in the α - Al matrix . 
Also the plate like primary and needle like eutectic Si phases have been broken down to ﬁ ne particulates of Si that have been uniformly distributed in the α - Al matrix . 
Hot pressing of as - spray formed alloy has further fragmented the Si , β and θ phases into ﬁ ne particles there by increasing the wear resistance of the alloy . 
Fig . 6b depicts the friction plot of Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys . 
The coef ﬁ cient of friction is found to be more or less constant in all the alloys but the coef ﬁ cient of friction of spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy is the lowest and that of as - cast Al – 28Si alloy is the highest . 
The worn surfaces of Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys at a load of 70 N are shown in Fig . 7 . 
The worn surface of as - cast Al – 28Si alloy specimen shown in Fig . 7a clearly indicates the mark of an adhesive wear with plastic deformation . 
The gross plastic ﬂ ow of metal , metallic fracture of ridges , edge cracking and large dimples can be seen on the worn surface of the as - cast alloy . The block - like primary Si particles are more easily detached from matrix and the debris of Si particles is embedded in the matrix , resulting in deep and non - uniform grooves . 
Typical surface damage , abrasive scoring marks , deeper and wider craters are also clearly observable . 
As seen in Fig . 7c the worn surface of as - spray formed Al – 28Si alloy shows smooth appearance with small grooves due to plastic deformation on the surface and oxidation of asperities , indicating the existence of mixed metallic and abrasive wear . The low wear rate of the as - spray formed alloy compared to as - cast alloy is attributed to the microstructural re ﬁ nement and large amount of ﬁ ne and uniformly distributed Si particles in α - Al matrix . 
With increasing load , the fragmentation of Si particles and their ability to support the load results in the direct contact of matrix with the counter face and a large strain within the α - Al matrix adjacent to contact surfaces . 
This might lead to the subsurface crack growth and delamination . 
The broken ﬁ ne hard Si particles entrapped between the counter face and the alloy may act as third - body abraders that may be responsible for the ﬁ ne longitudinal grooves on the worn surface . 
The worn surface of spray formed + hot pressed Al – 28Si alloy shown in Fig . 7e reveals pronounced smooth sliding marks containing shallow grooves with smaller width ridges and few small dimples . 
The smaller width is due to the re ﬁ nement of the primary Si phase caused during hot pressing . 
For the material with higher hardness , abrasive wear tends to take place , while for material with lower hardness adhesive wear is encountered [ 17 ] . 
In the present study , for spray formed + hot pressed alloy with hardness value 116 , abrasive wear has been found to be the main mechanism , while for as - cast alloy with hardness value 67 , adhesive wear has taken place . 
Thus , it can be said that the wear mechanism may also depends on the hardness of the material . 
The worn surfaces of Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys are shown in Fig . 7b , d and f . 
The worn surfaces of all the alloys are less damaged compared to that of Al – 28Si alloys . 
The reason is due to addition of Fe and Cu alloying elements to Al – 28Si alloy . 
The β - phase is hard and increases the hardness of the alloy and θ - Al2Cu phase provides strengthening effect to Al matrix there by reducing the chances of peeling off of Si phase from the Al matrix . 
This again improves the wear resistance of the alloy . 
The surface damage observed in asspray formed alloy is lesser than that of as - cast alloy . 
This is due to the re ﬁ nement of Si , β - phase into ﬁ ne needles and θ - phase into ﬁ ne particles in the as - spray formed alloy . 
The surface damage observed in spray formed and hot pressed alloy is lesser than that observed in as - spray formed alloy . 
This is because of further fragmentation of Si , β and θ phases into ﬁ ner particles and reduction of porosity due to hot pressing . 
The as - cast alloy is characterized by deep scoring marks . 
This is less in as - spray formed alloy and still lesser in spray formed and hot pressed alloy . 
The following conclusions may be drawn from the present study on the spray forming and hot pressing of Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys : 
( 1 ) Spray forming is effective in re ﬁ ning the microstructures of Al – 28Si and Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloys . 
Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy consisted of ﬁ ne and uniform distribution of β - Al4FeSi2 and θ - Al2Cu phases along with primary Si particles in Al matrix . 
( 2 ) Hot pressing has reduced the porosity by 50 % in Al – 28Si and 73 % in Al – 28Si – 5Cu - 4Fe alloys . 
( 3 ) Spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy showed highest hardness value of 160VHN compared to as - spray formed and as - cast alloys . 
( 4 ) Addition of Cu and Fe increased the wear resistance of Al – 28Si alloy . 
The wear resistance is highest and the coef ﬁ cient of friction is lowest for spray formed and hot pressed Al – 28Si – 5Cu – 4Fe alloy compared to as - spray formed and as - cast alloys .
